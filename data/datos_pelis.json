But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. \n\nThe only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.\n\nI didn&apos;t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don&apos;t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, &quot;Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.&quot; At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.\n\nNo action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it&apos;s technical merits - I don&apos;t really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",

            "name": "An offer so good, I couldn&apos;t refuse",
            "reviewBody": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I should probably go to bed. It&apos;s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.\n\nThis film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it&apos;s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.\n\nBut it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it&apos;s not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter&apos;s wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.\n\nThe more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone&apos;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister&apos;s wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.\n\nInside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.\n\nThis is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.\n\nMost masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; or &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",

It is a film which does better than its predessor, &quot;The Godfather&quot;.  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael&apos;s struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola&apos;s and Nino Rota&apos;s score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb."

The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word &quot;go&quot;. The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.",

At first I thought, well, maybe I&apos;ll watch a few minutes of it- it&apos;s so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn&apos;t seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn&apos;t something to dwell on.\n\nThis time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven&apos;t in years- but that&apos;s a good thing.  I&apos;ve been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.\n\nNow, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.\n\nI will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn&apos;t he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly &quot;sentimental&quot; passage with violins going haywire.\n\nRegardless, I&apos;m in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

            "reviewBody": "Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these &quot;Rings&quot; films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies&apos; long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the &quot;Fellowship&quot; film.\n\nAnyway, &quot;Fellowship,&quot; stunned me for the visuals alone. I can&apos;t recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don&apos;t care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.\n\nThe story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It&apos;s an incredible movie experience.",

            "reviewBody": "When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested.  A movie about guys who fight - it didn&apos;t seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment.  I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced.  I should see this movie.  I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD.  I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again.  And again.  And again.\n\nThis movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic.  I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn&apos;t turn my eyes away.  Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton&apos;s best performance and Pitt&apos;s second best (12 Monkeys).\n\nNorton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life.  He needs something to change his life.  Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away.  Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching.  As for it&apos;s ending, it doesn&apos;t rival &apos;The Sixth Sense&apos; - it blows it away.  One of the best movie endings I&apos;ve seen.  Even better if you&apos;re a Pixies fan.\n\nAs for it being important, don&apos;t worry.  You will be hearing about this movie.  When &apos;A Clockwork Orange&apos; came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic.  These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books.  If you haven&apos;t read either, get to it.  Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequenceless violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today&apos;s youth are being influenced by.\n\nWatch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends.  10 out of 10."

            "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump (1994) \n\n**** (out of 4) \n\nForrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow but simple man from Alabama takes us through decades of his life, which includes various historical settings but all the while his heart is on Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), a childhood friend.\n\nFORREST GUMP was released and quickly became a huge hit and ended up winning many Oscars. Today, for whatever reason, the film seems to be hated by many people because of the movies it beat out. I&apos;ve never really understood putting too much importance on Oscars or any other award show and I really don&apos;t understand why one movie must take a beating just because of what films it beat out. ORDINARY PEOPLE takes a beating because it beat RAGING BULL. Something like DANCES WITH WOLVES takes a beating because it beat GOODFELLAS. Then there&apos;s FORREST GUMP that takes a beating because it beat out PULP FICTION or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.\n\nAs far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I&apos;ve always liked how the film took a look at a simple person&apos;s life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they&apos;ve entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it&apos;s always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture.\n\nI thought the story itself was quite great and especially how we take a look at American history through the 60s, 70s and 80s. I know some people make this a political movie but I&apos;ve always found that to be rather foolish. The film has a wonderful soundtrack to highlight the various eras that are shown and we also get some clever use of CGI to put Gump in the presence of people like JFK and Richard Nixon. The screenplay hits all the right notes and there&apos;s no question that technically speaking the film is impressive.\n\nThen there are the performances that really make the movie. Hanks picked up his second Best Actor award and while I personally would have given it to Paul Newman for his performance in NOBODY&apos;S FOOL, there&apos;s no question that Hanks is great here. He certainly nailed that &quot;simple&quot; man and there&apos;s not a false moment in the performance. Gary Sinise is wonderful in his role as is Mykelti Williamson in his small bit. Robin Wright Penn is the perfect opposite to Hank&apos;s character and Sally Field is good as well.\n\nNo matter what people say, FORREST GUMP is still a wonderful little gem that has a lot of great things in it."

            "reviewBody": "Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.\n\nThis film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who&apos;s leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn&apos;t feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.\n\nIn size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word &quot;epic&quot; and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what&apos;s going on.\n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "My five children were all pre-teens when &apos;The Empire Strikes Back&apos; came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the &apos;Star Wars&apos; trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.\n\nIt is fruitless trying to argue &apos;which is best&apos; in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case &apos;Star Wars&apos;, starts it all and has to be the &apos;father&apos;. However, an argument can be made that &apos;The Empire Strikes Back&apos; (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. \n\nMy wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."

Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.\n\nIf we say it sci-fi at its best, it won&apos;t be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it&apos;s understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.\n\nA salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.",

Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a &quot;wiseguy&quot;, breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.\n\nAn example is De Niro&apos;s portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles. \n\nInteresting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn&apos;t think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film, so I shouldn&apos;t be surprised.",

OK, we don&apos;t put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn&apos;t changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...\n\nWhen the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can&apos;t help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people&apos;s eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone, this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "Having seen Kurosawa&apos;s Seven Samurai at least 10 times, I still see something new every time I watch it.  I don&apos;t see how anyone, especially a non-Japanese, could possibly absorb this movie in less than 2 or 3 viewings. I&apos;ve always been surprised at how each of the 7 samurai can make such an individual impression on you even if you can&apos;t understand Japanese. Although Toshiro Mifune is often considered the star, for me its Takashi Shimura who is firmly fixed at the center of the movie.  He is the guiding moral force from the moment of his appearance in the film and can capture the viewer&apos;s attention in a way similar to Alec Guinness.  Mifune&apos;s character can be annoying at first in his loutish behavior, but he gains stature throughout the film and eventually becomes a unifying force second only to Shimura.  Minoru Chiaki as the woodcutting samurai provides a subtle humor and the others look to him to boost their morale.  Daisuke Kato is another very familiar face to Japanese movie fans and provides an excellent foil to Shimura as his second in command.  Yoshio Inaba is very good as the samurai who is recruited by Shimura and quickly builds a strong rapport with him.  Seiji Miyaguchi as the &quot;expert&quot; warrior, dedicated to honing his skill as a swordsman is a very low key yet likeable character.  Ko Kimura as the young hero-worshipping samurai, as well as the love interest of the peasant girl, wishes to be a great samurai, but is easily distracted by a field of flowers or a pretty face.  The peasants in the village being defended by the samurai each have their own defining characteristics as well.\n\nIn addition to the wealth of interesting characters, we have a terrific action plot--the defending of the village from 40 marauding bandits by the small troop of samurai--, and a more subtle secondary plot involving the distrust of the samurai by the villagers due to the historical interaction of these two classes in feudal Japan.  All of these plot and character elements are woven together into an unforgettable epic, but, at least in my opinion, its not one that can be absorbed in a single sitting.  While it&apos;s similar in this sense to another of my favorite epics, Leone&apos;s Once Upon a Time in the West, it is more complex given the number of characters.\n\nI can only say that your patience with this film will probably be well rewarded if you take the time to give it multiple viewings.  You will also have the pleasure of seeing many of the samurai and villagers pop up in other Kurosawa films and films of other Japanese directors.  If you like Mifune and Shimura in this one, catch them in Stray Dog and Drunken Angel in very different settings and parts.  \n\nThis one is 10 out of 10 without a doubt."

            "reviewBody": "This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It&apos;s a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won&apos;t be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you&apos;ve seen it, please don&apos;t spoil it for others, just like you won&apos;t want it spoiled for yourself.",

The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.\n\nThe cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, but with its own unique flavour to it.\n\nThe City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed.",

I saw this movie last Christmas and I did not find it funny, but I loved it, though! Everything is so great in this movie. The story is amazing. The characters are great, and the character&apos;s development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.\n\nThis is the best feel-good movie ever. It&apos;s a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible! When you&apos;re sad, think about the message this movie delivers, because you will get a smile on your face! I&apos;m 14 years old. My English is not very good, but I hope this review was useful!",

I feel sorry for people who refuse to watch a movie like Life Is Beautiful just because it is a foreign film. They have no idea what a beautifully acted and directed film this is, and they&apos;ll never know what an amazing experience they are missing. \n\nLife Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler&apos;s List. \n\nThis is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It manages to be so encompassing that you hardly notice the subtitles are even there. I proudly cast my vote of 10.",

No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle. \n\nSteven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up.

Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good.",

I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It&apos;s just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It&apos;s not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it&apos;s the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it&apos;s heading (no pun intended), but it doesn&apos;t change the fact that it&apos;s beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.\n\nGoing out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It&apos;s the best possible way this could go, even if it&apos;s not in our grasps just yet ...",

The characters are beautifully and lovingly created and the colouring and setting of this film is absolutely superb. This is a beautiful little film and I can&apos;t wait for the next feature from Hayao Miyazaki-he is better than Walt Disney.\n\nMiyazaki blends the characters and the environment very well together, and I can see that this would be enjoyed for people at many different levels. Miyazaki enjoys creating female heroines and I was pleased that Chihiro lived up to the expression and beauty of her predecessors-like Nausicaa from the Valley of the Wind. This is beautiful and I would advise anyone to take a look at it&apos;s scope and serenity, along with it&apos;s fast paced plot and of course, the dreamlike settings that make it truly wonderful."

            "reviewBody": "Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same  name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the  book, which in itself is a great read.  I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the  movie, I didn&apos;t see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left  out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way  detract from either work.  As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn&apos;t compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn&apos;t a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars. Great story, great cast, great look."

            "reviewBody": "Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.\n\nThe plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of &quot;Ran&quot;, &quot;Kagemusha&quot; and &quot;Sword of Doom&quot;) arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think &quot;Wild Bunch with katanas&quot;, though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).\n\nKobayashi&apos;s direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai&apos;s performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.\n\nIf you&apos;re open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you&apos;ve ever seen.",

            "reviewBody": "I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nThis is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. \n\nRoman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary&apos;s Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar&apos;s are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a &quot;film&quot; like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.\n\nThe Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.\n\nUltimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I&apos;ve witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.\n\nI think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.\n\n10 out of 10"

            "reviewBody": "What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80&apos;s and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It&apos;s simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! \n\nI firstly saw this movie in the early 90&apos;s as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.\n\nBack to the Future (1985) \n\nFrom the Academy Award &quot;- winning team of Steven Spielberg&quot; and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty&apos;s assistance for his new invention.\n\nAt that night Marty went to assist Doc&apos;s invention the Time traveling Car &quot;DeLorean&quot;. Marty was told to record Doc&apos;s first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.\n\nAfter killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.\n\nWhat will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80&apos;s and 50&apos;s. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.\n\nThey really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.\n\nMore than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines&apos;s two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost &quot;chewed every scenes&quot; in the movie. Mr. Lloyd&apos;s versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.\n\nLast but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don&apos;t know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn&apos;t be made without the songs &quot;The Power of Love,&quot; and &quot;Earth Angel&quot;.\n\nThe rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as &quot; A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! &quot;",

            "reviewBody": "The Usual Suspects is two movies in one.  Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round.  The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself&apos; moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer.  It requires a certain amount of commitment, though.  Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.\n\nIt concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea.  The plot is rather intricate so I shan&apos;t bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before.  That&apos;s not to say it doesn&apos;t work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.\n\nGabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger &apos;Verbal&apos; Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic.  The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze&apos;s right-hand man.  He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.\n\nDirector Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts."

            "reviewBody": "What can you say about a film that&apos;s been talked about to death? Just this: If you&apos;ve never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it&apos;s a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it&apos;s so fun to watch.\n\nJanet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss&apos;s obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk&apos;s possessive mother, who as her boy explains, &quot;is not herself today.&quot; I&apos;ll say she isn&apos;t, and so would Leigh&apos;s Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that &quot;Do-Not-Disturb&quot; sign before taking a shower.\n\nYou can feel the decade literally shifting out of &apos;50s and into &apos;60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what&apos;s going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.\n\nMost especially, there&apos;s Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion&apos;s boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word &quot;falsity&quot; or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.\n\nHe shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam&apos;s boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you&apos;re always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he&apos;s busy covering up &quot;Mother&apos;s&quot; misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.\n\nIf you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote&apos;s. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for &quot;Psycho.&quot; Certainly &quot;Psycho&quot; looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.\n\nIt&apos;s thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.\n\nIs it the best Hitchcock movie? It&apos;s definitely one of his best, right up there with &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; and &quot;Strangers On A Train&quot; and &quot;Sabotage&quot; and &quot;Shadow Of A Doubt.&quot; He only once again came close to making as good a film, with &quot;The Birds,&quot; while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.\n\nOften imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, &quot;Psycho&quot; still isn&apos;t played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",

I simply LOOOOVED the music. It&apos;s one of the best soundtracks I&apos;ve ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can&apos;t tell in words how much I love the song &quot;Can You Feel The Love Tonight&quot;. Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly.",

Excellent criticism of the Taylorism/capitalistic through humor relevant for any age, nationality or time; story-telling that would touch anyone alike in a universal fashion, every now and then sparkled with Chaplin&apos;s unique and deeply influential sense of humor and on-screen comedy. Hilarious in moments, and unique. A man of many talents clearly, and excellent at those. Overall this depicts quite a zany approach to life, one that is pure in essence and profoundly antagonistic with the current ways of the time, and ways of today still: a life dominated by one-track thinking, rigid and stubborn social etiquette, and the enslavement this new world has brought in so many aspects to the human species. Finally, it highlights the importance of never giving up; EVER; and the preciousness of love.",

            "reviewBody": "I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago.  It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions.  At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up.  It would&apos;ve seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.\n\nSeeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.\n\nI&apos;ve made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn&apos;t moved (usually to tears) by this movie, you&apos;ve found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.\n\nThere are many other reviews of this movie, and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I&apos;ll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.\n\nWhen you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper, think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened, and your eyes opened a bit more.\n\nI&apos;ve only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to &quot;decompress&quot; after watching it.  To see it too often would lessen the impact, and that would be the worst possible thing to do to this movie.",

Gosh I wished I wouldn&apos;t have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it&apos;s a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can&apos;t even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can&apos;t get why they didn&apos;t gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!",

            "reviewBody": "http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/\n\nEver had a dream of being a great football player? A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn&apos;t come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.\n\nAndrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.\n\nI had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, &quot;run the table now,&quot; he would tell me, I failed. It&apos;s embarrassing when that happens but it&apos;s also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can&apos;t get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.\n\nI lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.\n\nMy expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.\n\nRecommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.\n\nRe-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can&apos;t wait until it hits distribution.\n\nMemorable: I am still thinking about this film.",

            "reviewBody": "The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century&apos;s answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - &quot;the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor&quot;.\n\nOnce a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena&apos;s, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as &quot;The Spaniard&quot;.\n\nAnd with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of &apos;blockbuster&apos; that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.\n\nThe cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of &apos;internationally casted films&apos;), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who &quot;should have been a son&quot; and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is &apos;right&apos;. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.\n\nAdd to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see."

            "reviewBody": "This is my favorite Chaplin film, but I don&apos;t want that to diminish his other work, either. MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn&apos;t make a bad movie, and I&apos;m not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.\n\nThat ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it&apos;s a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin&apos;s little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It&apos;s a monument to understated sentimentality.\n\nTo me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it&apos;s that ending that makes us all love this movie."

I&apos;ve not seen a film showing our world with such humour in a long time. The jokes are absurd and possibly, with a touch of British humour to them. The directing is beautiful, the acting is incredible, the shots are somehow truthful, if I can say that about a shot. It may be Omar Sy&apos;s first time in a leading role, for a major production, but he really delivered, and not just in the funny parts, the delivery of emotions was just spotless. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as he usually is. I will be recommending this film to everyone, and seriously hoping it will be released in the UK soon enough for me to see it again! Only negative aspect... the Americans are thinking of doing a remake... why do they always have to? I mean would you reconsider remaking the &quot;Joconde&quot; or the Sixtine Chapel to American standards? Film is an art like any other, it travels the world as it is... no need for remakes..."

The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.",

            "reviewBody": "There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as &apos;The Battle of the Anthems&apos; throughout the film&apos;s long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick&apos;s Caf\u00e9 American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play &apos;Le Marseilles (sic?)&apos; the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd&apos;s dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover. \n\nAs I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club&apos;s wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo&apos;s act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on. \n\nBasically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.\n\nThe thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick&apos;s is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him. \n\nThis is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne&apos;s portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.",

Sergio Leone gave time to each scene... something that new directors seem afraid to do... Great story about the last days of an era. Amazing music and the originality of linking a specific melody to each main character. And all these close-up to character&apos;s eyes... Just a wonderful movie.",

            "reviewBody": "Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it&apos;s one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can&apos;t imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD&apos;s documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart&apos;s neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart&apos;s reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (&quot;Miss Torso&quot;), then one of the last surviving cast members. Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed.",

Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There&apos;s also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It&apos;s fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let&apos;s hope they&apos;ll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !",

            "name": "In my opinion, Coppola&apos;s best work",
            "reviewBody": "My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary &apos;Heart of Darkness&apos; made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making &apos;the Godfather&apos; and &apos;GodfatherII&apos; and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like &apos;Apocalypse Now&apos;. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz&apos;s compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN&apos;T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about &apos;Apocalypse Now&apos; is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. \n\nThis movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn&apos;t at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is &apos;Platoon&apos; in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. \n\nCoppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.\n\nIt is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.\n\nA little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the &apos;Redux&apos; version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a &apos;new and improved&apos; version of the movie",

            "reviewBody": "This ingenious and innovate comedy packs many priceless moments and great sense of pace , though overlong . Chaplin&apos;s satire with several classic scenes , he has dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel , an offensive portrayal of Hitler . Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and there happens bemusing events . Funny and extraordinary acting all around , as the stunning co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-alike) , Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-alike) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering) . Chaplin&apos;s first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss . This splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes , the funniest are the followings : 1) The one when during the WWI the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without to be aware 2) When Dictator Adenoid Hynkel tells overacting speeches , including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel playing with an enormous world balloon 4) The Jew-barber shaving a man while fitting to Hungarian Dance : number 5 by Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber&apos;s chair , among them .\n\nProduction on the movie started in 1937 and shot in 539 days when not nearly as many people believed Nazism was a menace , as was the case when it was released in 1940 ; however , this film was ultimately upstaged as the first anti-Nazi film satire . Hitler banned movie exhibition to the Germans due to its satire of him , and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of America . The movie is co-starred by Paulette Goddard , third of his four wives , they were married in 1936 , although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished The Great Dictator . The picture was released in 1940 , when Chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the House of Un-American Activities was the signal for the USA to refuse him re-entry from Britain and he fled to Switzerland . This movie was Charles Chaplin&apos;s biggest-ever box-office hit , grossing about $5 million at the time.",

            "name": "Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish",
            "reviewBody": "I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino&apos;s latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.\n\nWhat pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. \n\nThe film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino \u2013 he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django&apos;s editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino&apos;s work up until now.\n\nBut then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.\n\nActing wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he&apos;s ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object \u2013 but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie&apos;s adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.\n\nSurprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django&apos;s shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.\n\nWaltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. \n\nFor all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. \n\n8/10.",

            "reviewBody": "I am still quite speechless. Overwhelmed by how utterly compelling the story was and by how emotive the acting story was. Floored by the unbelievably great character development. This film is close to perfect. It is a spiritual cousin to 2004&apos;s magnificent Downfall and shares a lot of similarities with Paul Verhoeven&apos;s stunning Black Book from last year, not just because these films share two actors. This multi-faceted character driven masterpiece really is as good as it&apos;s hype says.\n\nSebastian Koch in particular absolutely shines. He is one of the best international actors working today and he follows the brilliance of his role in Black Book with the lead here. With his bohemian, dishevelled good looks and brilliant charisma, he&apos;s the best German-speaking actor since Bruno Ganz. But he is far from the only good actor in this movie, Ulrich M\u00fche as the State Security (Stasi) agent whose task it is to monitor Koch&apos;s suspiciously free thinking playwright, brings another near perfect performance to the movie. Agent Wiesler initially appears to the audience as the polar opposite of Koch&apos;s character. With his grey button down clothing, closely cropped hair and consistently emotionless face he symbolises everything about the overbearing untrusting Socialist government of East Germany that is wrong. He could easily have remained that character throughout the whole film but he becomes the surprising emotional centre of the story and the line between heroes and villains is significantly shifted (something which extends to the supporting cast as well. Truth be told there are probably only two characters in this film whom I didn&apos;t have to rethink my opinion of). Weisler reveals himself as a lonely, isolated man who risks his entire career as his attitude to his subject changes from one of mistrust to one of near-adoration. There is an undeniable link between the two characters even though they never share a single scene and Georg Dreyman (Koch) doesn&apos;t even find about Wiesler until the last 10 minutes of the movie, which leads us up to what should go down as one of the greatest endings in cinema history. Just thinking about the final spoken lines brings the tears to my eyes.\n\nAs I said, without a doubt one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. And as much as I adore Pan&apos;s Labyrinth, this one really did deserve it&apos;s Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. An absolute masterpiece.",

            "reviewBody": "Almost one hundred years later the concept of that static war of the trenches that was the Western front of World War I is almost unfathomable. After the French army stopped the German offensive at the Battle of the Marne, the French and British armies faced the Germans in a line of trenches that stretched from Belgium to Switzerland. About a quarter of France was occupied for four years in that time. The casualties ran into the millions in that stalemate that gains were only measured in meters.\n\nIt was always just one more offensive over the top charging into automatic weapon fire that would break the other guy. Just such an offensive was planned one day in 1916 against a German stronghold dubbed the ant hill. \n\nGeneral George MacReady, promised a promotion by his superior Adolphe Menjou, orders a beaten and tired battalion to charge the ant hill. The attack flops and MacReady looks for scapegoats. He decides after coming down from shooting 100 men to a selected three drawn by lot. The unlucky three are Joseph Turkel, Ralph Meeker, and Timothy Carey.\n\nThe commander of the three Kirk Douglas asks to serve as their counsel and he makes a good show of it at the kangaroo court martial they have. But the fix is definitely in.\n\nExcept for Spartacus, Kirk Douglas rarely plays straight up heroic types in film. Even his good guys have an edge to them, a dark side. But as Colonel Dax, Douglas is at his most heroic. He may be one dimensional here, but he&apos;s great. Especially in that last scene with Adolphe Menjou when he tells the man off in no uncertain terms, mainly because Menjou has misread Douglas&apos;s motives. \n\nMenjou and Macready portray two different military types. The arrogant MacReady as versus the very sly Menjou. Not very admirable either of them. Menjou was not very popular at this time in Hollywood because of the blacklist. He favored it very much, his politics were of the extreme right wing. Nevertheless he was a brilliant actor and never better than in this film, one of his last.\n\nThe enlisted men are a good bunch also. They&apos;re kind of like the posse in The Oxbow Incident, just an ordinary group who become ennobled in martyrdom as they go to the firing squad for the sake of politics.\n\nPaths of Glory is one of the best anti-war films ever made. It ranks right up there with All Quiet on the Western Front which showed the war from the German point of view. Both will be classics 200, 300, a thousand years from now.",

            "reviewBody": "Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. &quot;Norma Desmond&quot; and &quot;Joe Gillis&quot; are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned &quot;10,000 midnights ago&quot;. How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman&apos;s THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld&apos;s GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.\n\nThe images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool, eyes wide open, looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma&apos;s courtyard (&quot;That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps.&quot; says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden&apos;s last drop of naivet\u00e9 combine to give us one of the most electrifying &quot;give and take&quot; between actors I&apos;ve ever witnessed.\n\nBoth lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even &quot;wax figures&quot; (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma&apos;s to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND, Zanuck, Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for &quot;ruining the industry&quot;. The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma, who is quite insane, and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him, but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille, who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday, tries to set her straight, telling her pictures have &quot;changed&quot;. They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.\n\nScenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate), and Norma&apos;s mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that &quot;Valentino once danced on.&quot; There is so much to discuss, but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN&apos; IN THE RAIN, one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.\n\nRATING: 10 of 10",

            "reviewBody": "From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook! ....................................\n\nShame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews for Wall-E. My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you&apos;ve set for it! Don&apos;t get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others would have you believe.\n\nThe movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least incorporated with a fresh twist.\n\nWall-E most definitely has its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the &quot;Gee, aren&apos;t we just the cutest on screen Bots you&apos;ve ever seen?&quot; Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialog for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious.\n\nFortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the recent years. Taken as a whole, though, Wall-E deserves between 8 and 8 1/2*. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just watch Wall-E, hopefully, leaving your expectations behind. You&apos;ll probably have a very enjoyable and entertaining 90 minutes.\n\n8* STARS*...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Espa\u00f1ol, are most welcome!",

            "reviewBody": "That&apos;s a quotation from the film and what you&apos;ll say at the conclusion. I saw it the first time 36 years ago back when network TV ran old movies late at night, and I&apos;d never even heard of it. I thought it was a Hitchcock film with all of the unexpected twists, but no, the director was Billy Wilder. How surprised I was to see Wilder do Hitchcock better than Hitchcock ever could! The set-up is this - Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is an inventor that is having trouble getting his inventions to market. He befriends a wealthy older woman, one Emily French. She is obviously flirting with him, and Vole, though married, flirts back, his objective being that maybe she will financially back one of his inventions. Then disaster strikes. Emily French is found murdered. Vole is an obvious suspect because Mrs. French has just changed her will and left everything to Vole. There is circumstantial evidence pointing to Vole, and he says he knows nothing about the will. Enter barrister Sir Wilfred, the finest in England, whose doctor has told him he must quit work and go on a vacation because of his heart condition. Sir Wilfred talks to Vole, believes his story, and also talks to his wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich) who backs up Leonard&apos;s story but comes across as somewhat cold to her husband&apos;s peril. Sir Wilfred is convinced to take the case and agrees to retire upon this last trial. Past that I cannot tell you any details or I&apos;ll ruin it for you.\n\nEveryone in the cast performs masterfully. Especially charming is the interaction between Laughton&apos;s character and his nurse played by his wife of then 28 years, Elsa Lanchester. They go back and forth at each other with Nurse Pimsoll insisting that Sir Wilfred keep his rigid schedule of medications and him treating her like a jailer with hilarious one liners at the poor woman&apos;s expense. Only a long married couple could do this feature length banter so well. If Nightmare Alley didn&apos;t convince you that Tyrone Power was more than a pretty face, this film will. Likewise, Marlene Dietrich is much more than a blue angel and a fine figure of a woman at age 56.\n\nNotice all of the little touches. How Sir Wilfred seems to be ignoring testimony in court by counting out his pills, only to stand up and ask insightful questions when his turn comes. Plus this film really shows that nothing is off the record, even if the judge says that it is - the jury hears and sees everything. Sir Wilfred plays on that fact.\n\nGreat acting, great direction, great story - it doesn&apos;t get any better than this. Thus I give this a solid 10/10. And one irony - Power&apos;s character mentions several times about Sir Wilfred&apos;s heart, but it is Tyrone Power himself who will be dead of a heart attack by the end of the following year. Sadly, this is his last completed film.",

Iron Man\n\nWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I&apos;ve seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.\n\nAnd the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.\n\nPlus our the villains are so well done..\n\nBut I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.\n\nIt&apos;s been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.",

He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn&apos;t deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It&apos;s only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.\n\nThis is one of Jack Nicholson&apos;s finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she&apos;s genuinely filled with fear - but doesn&apos;t have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn&apos;t have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack&apos;s show.\n\nThe story doesn&apos;t stick to King&apos;s novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick&apos;s Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.\n\nKubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It&apos;s one of the best examples of his masterful touch.\n\nOverall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director."

            "reviewBody": "Who&apos;d have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn&apos;t expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb, so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven&apos;t seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick&apos;s side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven&apos;t laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn&apos;t overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what&apos;s even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clich\u00e9s... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, and very well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick&apos;s most well-paced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I&apos;m not too fond of Sellers, but here he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick&apos;s other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick&apos;s films, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can&apos;t really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I&apos;ll just suggest you see it. Seriously, if you enjoy Kubrick&apos;s sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you&apos;re going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did, but you&apos;ll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can&apos;t praise it enough. See it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won&apos;t regret it. I know I didn&apos;t. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10",

Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.\n\nMany people accuse this film of being &quot;unrealistic&quot;. These people forget that this a film, not a documentary. No one complains About Star Wars being unrealistic, and rightly so. Films have a right to stretch out reality, don&apos;t forget the reason it does this is to be entertaining.\n\nAlthough the film has strong violence of a graphic nature, I advise you to watch it, if only to broaden your perspectives of world and Asian cinema.",

It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn&apos;t start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!",

            "reviewBody": "I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn&apos;t be possible. I&apos;ve not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can&apos;t compliment this movie enough. If you haven&apos;t someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won&apos;t be disappointed.",

            "reviewBody": "Sergio Leone&apos;s films are all love letters to America, the American dreams of an Italian who grew up at the movies, who apprenticed with Wyler, and Aldrich, signed himself Bob Robertson, and gave us Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Charles Bronson as we know them.  Sadly, America didn&apos;t always repay the compliment.  Leone&apos;s were &quot;spaghetti westerns&quot;, money makers to be sure, but deemed  disrespectful of the great tradition of Ford, Walsh and Hathaway. Many critics and Holllywood insiders called his earlier Eastwood films cynical and violent bottom-line commercial exploitation.  By the time that they caught on to Leone&apos;s genuine popular appeal, the director had already moved on.  And, his Once Upon a Time in the West was damned as pretentious, bloated, self-indulgent: an art film disguised as a Western, the Heaven&apos;s Gate of its day. That film&apos;s canny blend of pop appeal and pure cinematic genius gradually dawned on the powers that be (or were), and helped give rise to the renaissance of American filmmaking in the early seventies. It is worth noting that The Godfather could have been made by Leone, had he chosen. Leone had been pitching a gangster film that would encompass generations, for a generation or two, himself.  Rather than do the Puzo version finally thrown back at him, he waited an eternity, and finally realized this, his last finished project.  That ellipse of a decade or so between conception and completed movie is paralleled in the film, itself, by Robert De Niro&apos;s (&quot;Noodles&apos;&quot;) opium dream of the  American twentieth century, its promises, and betrayals.  Naturally, Leone was betrayed, once again, himself, by America, and this truly amazing film, with its densely multi-layered, overlapping flashback structure was butchered upon its release, becoming a linear-plotted sub-Godfather knockoff in the process. Luckily, the critics had grown up enough in the meantime to finally get a glimmering of what Leone was up to, and demand restitution.  Very few saw it properly in theaters, but the video version respects the director&apos;s intentions, more or less.  Ironically, Leone had foreseen television screen aspect ratios as determining home viewing of the future, and abbreviated his usual wide screen format for this movie, so this most troubled last project was the first released on video to most properly  resemble the true cinematic experience.  For diehard fans of the Eastwood westerns impatient with this at first, watch those movies till you want and need more.  This will eventually get to you.  For art film fanatics who don&apos;t get the earlier Leones, travel in the reverse direction, and you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is the movie that Leone spent a decade conceiving. It will deliver for decades of viewing to come."

            "reviewBody": "I have taken so long to review this film because it has had so much of an emotional effect on me. It was also the first film I saw at AFI Festival and since I was genuinely shocked at how bad the subsequent films I saw there, I decided to get those out of the way first.\n\nWell, here I am, giving my review on the most heart-wrenching yet most beautiful film I have ever seen. The &quot;acting&quot; was absolutely extraordinary (standouts are from a young eleven year old boy and a one year old baby). The score from the director&apos;s husband happens to be one of my favorite pieces of music from the decade. The cinematography manages to take some of the most disgusting places in the world and manages to give it beauty, especially through the gorgeous landscape and aerial shots.\n\nComing from a Lebanese female director, Capernaum is a film that discusses a variety of issues, but I will try to make it as simple as I can. In the present day, our main character, eleven year old Zain is a boy currently serving a sentence for stabbing a man. Through certain circumstances, Zain is able to take a break from jail to partake in a court case against his parents, where he is attempting to sue them for ever having him in the first place and to urge them to never have kids again. Through a series of flashbacks, we get to see Zain suffering in his large family of about seven to eight, including sisters of all ages, and two horribly misguided parents. The parents struggle financially, forcing their children to work long hours and never partake in school. The parents also abuse Zain for being extremely rebellious in nature (think of Rebel Without a Cause) and they starve him a lot. There is a lot of family issues here, but over the course of the film, Zain experiences a journey of a lifetime, running away from home and trying to make a life for himself, living life on the streets. Regardless of the amount of suffering Zain goes through, he delivers an utmost love and care for everyone around him.\n\nCapernaum is an extraordinary film that won my heart in every way. It depicts the harsh realities of the children living in squalor in Lebanon, and perhaps in all of the Middle East. Filmed as a narrative, Capernaum actually uses real life Syrian refugees and kids who were all going through extremely similar circumstances to the ones found in this film. The director and her husband were their following the screening, and they really emphasized how they spent 100s of hours in Lebanon, ensuring that they experienced the squalor themselves and the interviewed hundreds of children to get an idea of what life is like there.\n\nThe common theme: &quot;I wish I never lived&quot; or &quot;I wish my parents never had me.&quot;\n\nThe director took those two most common statements and developed a powerful film that gives humanity to these children who need it most. Perhaps the themes of love and compassion amidst squalor and pain could be a guiding light to all the children who are suffering in the foster care system or are getting abused here in the United States as well. I just hope Capernaum spreads awareness to all people throughout the world that child abuse is still rampant throughout the world, and all children want to be is loved. All people want to be is accepted and have a home. All people just wanted to be treated like a *queues Tommy Wiseau&apos;s voice* human being.\n\nHonestly, I am proud to say this is currently my favorite film of all time. At two and a half hours long, I was begging for more at the end. Bring lots of tissues, but also do not be afraid to let loose and laugh a little.\n\nRegardless of all the positive reviews for Roma, I am going to be rooting for Capernaum to win Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards. This experience changed my life, and I hope it does for you as well.\n\nFun Fact: The original cut was ten hours long.\n\nAnother fun fact: This received a 15 minute standing ovation at Cannes Film Festival, and it was well deserved."

People in certain professions don&apos;t like to watch movies about those professions (Doctors and Nurses shy away from hospital dramas, for example). Submarine sailors are different. We love to watch every submarine movie ever made, from &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; and &quot;Destination: Tokyo&quot; to &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot;, &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; and &quot;U-571&quot;. Why? Because we can always use a good laugh. For those in the know, submarine movies are usually absolutely hilarious. Except this one. After being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 different men, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarine sailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this film is the ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously. And that is the highest praise a movie like this can possibly get.",

The issues Kurosawa wrestles with in this, and his other films; the ethic responsibility we have as humans, humanity vs. greed, crime and punishment are universally understood. Nothing he presents in black and white(except literally in the film stock)-- but every shade of grey is reflected on. The story unfolds slowly but contains many twists and turns as the viewer questions the motives of each character. It&apos;s not just the force of good against evil--but a question of what is morally right and morally wrong. The title itself clues the viewer in to the ambiguities of class, greed, and moral ethic.",

            "reviewBody": "Some critics might claim to need a code key to interpret what Tarantino means by this revisionist adventure film, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s right under their up-turned noses: There&apos;s a great little scene where Mike Meyers plays a British military man who anticipates attacking a Nazi film premiere so he brings in an a film critic as an adviser. This may or may not be necessary but it does allow for a dialogue exchange like: Meyers: What do you do? Critic: I am a film critic.\n\nMeyers: What are your accomplishments? Even though the critic goes on to list some compilation books, it may as well be a rhetorical question.\n\nTarantino thumbs his nose at convention and that is part of the movie&apos;s appeal. His movies are often about movies as much as they are about the content at hand. Yet he still manages to sustain genuine tension. The opening Nazi interrogation of a French farmer and a later a tavern basement guessing game scene must have had whopping page counts but they play out as chapters and remain engrossing high stakes set pieces. In the same film he can introduce a character by throwing a title onto the screen as if this member of the &quot;Basterds&quot; was cool enough to have his own movie, or play a 1980&apos;s David Bowie song while a woman prepares to do battle in her own way while Nazi flags hang outside the window.\n\nThe movie takes place in an alternate universe that could either be a dream or the unreality of the grind-house era Tarantino has celebrated in Kill Bill and, well, Grindhouse. Anyone with a brain will get that. If that sounds good, see it. I notice now there are blurbs about &quot;how Jewish critics feel&quot; about the movie. Well, those who go to a movie with a deliberately misspelled title knowing it is a revisionist fantasy and can&apos;t bear to see the character of Hitler as the butt of the joke don&apos;t have an opinion worthy of note. If you are an expert on NASA, your views on George Lucas&apos; Star Wars movies are not necessarily of use to me. In fact it&apos;s a little galling that such a critic-proof designation as &quot;Jewish critic&quot; should be trotted out. They can say what they like about a sensitive document with the intentions of Schindler&apos;s List and God bless them. But if someone gets his boxers in a bunch over slapstick Nazis or clueless Hitler autographing the Grain Diary for Indiana Jones, then they just aren&apos;t going to be the right audience for Inglourious Basterds. In fact they shouldn&apos;t be watching fun movies at all. They should try staring at a blank wall and talking to themselves rather than type up their blather.\n\nBut it&apos;s not all fun. Sad things do happen and unfortunate events occur in this movie. The tension even in dialogue does come from the danger of having a Nazi at the table or someone daring to ask him to leave. But when you get reviewers comparing the Basterds to Al Qaida I think we can excuse those critics from the table as well. Or call Eli Roth over to them and yell &quot;Play ball!&quot;"

Among these obstacles were a straight-forward shrink who outright dared Will to bulls*** him (played by Robin Williams, who got his overdue Oscar for it), a brilliant M.I.T. professor who felt it his own personal redemption to put Will&apos;s mind to great use somehow (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, who never fails to steal nearly every scene he&apos;s in), and a girl who doesn&apos;t understand why the boy she loves so much cannot love her.\n\nIt was these obstacles that made Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships).  His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching."

            "reviewBody": "Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it&apos;s like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best &apos;steamed broccoli&apos; (ok, insert your favorite entr\u00e9e) I&apos;ve ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that&apos;s been me with &quot;Hamilton.&quot; For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn&apos;t all that. So, now I&apos;m here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance.\n\nUnfortunately (because of what I mentioned above) this can&apos;t be a comparison of a live stage performance and the film version. Instead, this will briefly outline what I noticed in the movie. First, and I believe this is key, the original stage director Thomas Kail is back to direct the film. It should be noted that the film version is a blend of a couple of recorded live shows, plus some recorded songs seamlessly edited in. This is the original cast doing what they do best, and the edits are imperceptible. Second, the main cast is filled with dynamic performers. In many stage shows, one or two actors are head and shoulders above the others. Not so here. At a minimum the top seven actors are as skilled and fun to watch as any you&apos;ve seen. Third, this is a true musical in that the songs drive the story. Some of the early songs require serious concentration to catch the lines, but even if you miss some lyrics, the gist of what&apos;s happening is pretty clear. These aren&apos;t so much catchy sing-along types, but you&apos;ll easily recall the scenes when you hear the songs again at a later date. We see a perfect melding of music-performance-story.\n\nOf course most everyone knows that Lin-Manuel Miranda is the creative force behind the show. He credits writer Ron Chernow&apos;s book on Alexander Hamilton as the inspiration for the production, but it&apos;s Mr. Miranda that appeared on every talk show for a couple of years, and he also performs as Alexander Hamilton. Daveed Diggs has dual roles as the flamboyant Marquis de Lafayette and the equally flamboyant (at least here) Thomas Jefferson. Renee Elise Goldsberry takes over the stage with her powerful voice as Angelica Schuyler, and Chris Jackson is a dominating physical presence as George Washington. Jonathan Groff (from &quot;Mindhunter&quot;) is absolutely hysterical and unforgettable as King George III, both through song and strut. Everyone will have their favorite performers, and truly they are all exceptional, and I&apos;d like to point out the two that took my breath away. Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton has a pristine voice that will bring tears to many eyes. She may not be as involved with the political elements of the story, but in the most emotional moments, she is front and center. Lastly, the passion Leslie Odom Jr brings to his role as Adam Burr is beyond description. He may be the &quot;villain&quot;, but he makes Burr accessible and easy to understand ... plus Odom is a terrific singer and performer, and he lights up the stage.\n\nIt&apos;s easy to overlook the dance and stage choreography since it&apos;s never over-the-top, but the dancers are terrific and the performers make great use of the single set - although props are regularly brought in and taken away. Perhaps what really makes this click as movie entertainment is the expert use of cameras and editing. We see the full stage when we should, and we are offered close-ups when it&apos;s most effective. I do hope to catch the live show at some point, but if my Hamilton experience is limited to this cinematic version, well ... &quot;that would be enough.&quot;",

While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the &apos;Star Wars&apos; trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.\n\nAfter the fantastic &apos;Star Wars&apos; and &apos;Empire Strikes Back&apos; (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode &apos;Return of the Jedi&apos; was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels&apos; battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke&apos;s Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. \n\nMy wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."

The story is simple: Byelorussia in 1943 and it&apos;s Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-asked war against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught in between (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to &quot;clear&quot; the rear of Third Panzer Army). Those who haven&apos;t been deported or killed by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them is Florya, a young boy - and in his quest to &quot;join the fight&quot; he get much more he had bargained for. It&apos;s a movie about an apocalyptic world (the title is taken from the Book of Revelation, a most of the movie looks like it has been filmed on another planet), but unfortunately it was all-real. The emotional centre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of a village, with all the sickening (but not exploitative) details shown with cold determination. There&apos;s no catharsis (this is not Schindler&apos;s List!), no hope, no redemption - even the eventual revenge against the village&apos;s destroyers become just a sad and murderous business. &quot;Come And See&quot; is a difficult, violent and surprisingly poetic movie, compared to which even classics like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (Spielberg payed a homage to this movie on SPR&apos;s beginning) or &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; seems just artificial.

            "reviewBody": "For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (&quot;like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes?&quot;), here&apos;s a word you might want to think about:\n\nBeauty.\n\n Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you&apos;ll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film&apos;s plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so. \n\n  &apos;2001&apos; requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don&apos;t get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they&apos;re not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different KINDS of film, and to enjoy &apos;2001&apos; you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.\n\n  &quot;All art is quite useless&quot; -  Oscar Wilde.",

            "reviewBody": "Reservoir Dogs is the debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.\n\nIt feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly \u00a36.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.\n\nTarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.\n\nYet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of &quot;ultra-violence,&quot; it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there&apos;s the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy&apos;s Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.\n\nAnd that&apos;s the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it&apos;s crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it&apos;s one of the very best. 9/10",

            "reviewBody": "(I notice that there are many spoilers here already,therefore I wont go much into the plot detail)\n\nThere seems to be an implied understanding that Aamir Khan represents the last word on intellectual mainstream cinema.It was many years back when he decided to curtail the number of projects he takes up in an year which was considered suicidal then but now is the norm for most of the top stars.For last 14 years this man has pushed the envelope for mainstream by taking some unprecedented risks with young directors and pulling it off time and time again.For some of us who have followed his career choices,there was a feeling that he would make a great director.His choices of films are a testimony to his understanding of the medium and the audience within the mainstream perspective.\n\n&quot;Taare Zameen Par&quot; is his first directorial venture,less by design and more by circumstances.Based on the brilliant script by Amol Gupte who is one of the innovative painters and theater personalities,the story dwells into the life of boy struggling to find himself in this ruthless world.Briefly,the boy &quot;Ishan&quot; who suffers from dyslexia comes from a middle class Indian family who is unable to read/learn or identify letters.Constantly bombarded with unrelenting taunts for his poor academics and being labeled as a &quot;duffer&quot;,he is isolated into his world of colors which is the only place he can seek solace in.But Ishan reaches a new low when he is packed off to boarding school by his father.The hard regimen and discipline of the school frustrates the boy out of his wits and he is finding drastic ways to put an end to his misery.He no longer feels th need to communicate .Just when things seem irrevocable,comes the art teacher,Aamir Khan,who being a dyslexic himself and working with the &quot;less privileged&quot; children identifies Ishan&apos;s troubles and can read through his silence,is sanitized by the apathy towards him.Then starts the process of resurrecting the boy&apos;s dying self belief and charting out a way for him to read and learn.The boy starts to slowly but surely come out of his shell and become a &quot;child&quot; again.\n\nOne of the many aspects of a perfect film is that nothing seems to stand out,every aspect whether it be the performances,the camera work,the sound mixing,the lighting,the editing etc everything seems in sync.Same can be said about this movie.But the thing that I found overwhelming as a viewer is the music by &quot;Shankar&quot;-Ehsaan-Loy&quot; and the lyrics by &quot;Prasoon Joshi&quot;.Watch out for &quot;taare zameen par&quot;,&quot;Meri Maa&quot;,these will definitely break you down.The cinematography by Setu is flawless and Aamir does not fall into the trap of being slick or showing off in his debut effort.(Watch how the camera is usually at Ishan&apos;s height to show his perspective,watch how slowly the camera pans into Ishan&apos;s space and how still and focused it is on his face when he is about to bare his emotions) \n\nThe performances are top draw.Darsheel who plays Ishan is the crux of the film.Being the main protagonist his performance was critical to the film.I dare say,we have found a new star.The boy is brilliant in his joy,in his enthusiasm,in his loneliness as he allows us to enter his world.I feel he represents children all over the world and more critically the &quot;child&quot; within all of us.Of the support cast Tisca Chopra and Aamir Khan are brilliant as his mother and teacher respectively.Because the movie revolves around a middle class family in suburban Mumbai,I guess these characters and their emotions are something I can relate to.\n\nFinally(on the movie),kudos to Amol Gupte and Aamir Khan.Let us not forget this was Amol&apos;s baby and he had worked with children and done research for 7 years.What he came with was a near perfect script and it is only fair that he was credited as a creative director.What can I say about Aamir Khan that hasn&apos;t been said before?I think with every movie he is setting new yardsticks for Indian cinema.His movies clearly have elaborated that our movies can have all the commercial trappings yet need not be &quot;dumbed down&quot;.They can be as intellectually stimulating.All I can say is that it is privilege to be in an era where this champion actor is at the absolute peak of his powers.With this movie he goes into the elite list of actors who happen to be great story tellers.\n\nBut is this movie about dyslexia?Is this movie about the failure of our education system in not nurturing the individual talent but creating assembly line products?Are we as a society so obsessed with the &quot;idea&quot; of security through academics that creativity is of no accord to us?Are we preparing our children for a rat race or we preparing them for life?Are parents right in imposing their ambitions on the life they bring to this earth ?Some question that I have asked of myself before and some that I ask now.I guess the main motive of the film is as the tag line says &quot;every child is special&quot; for the talent he has.Our job is to nurture it,not mold it.\n\np.s. I have been a frequent movie goer for last 7-8 years.But haven&apos;t seen a response like I did for this one.Everyone in the theater was in tears and simultaneous applause and is not because it was a sad film but it was &quot;overwhelming&quot;.I guess there some part of Ishan in all of our lives.The second aspect that I have never witnessed in theaters before was that nobody moved till the credits were over.There is documentary on children at the end(do not miss it for anything,it is as moving as the film)."

            "reviewBody": "Along with &quot;Psycho&quot;, Hitchcock&apos;s best film that wraps itself around the viewer very fast and never does let go. San Francisco detective Jimmy Stewart is slowly going crazy due to a failed mission which did not work because of his intense fear of heights. This is all front-page news of course and Stewart is shamed about the whole event. But a ray of light shines as he gets a job to watch a man&apos;s wife (Kim Novak) who is supposedly having an affair with another man. Stewart believes this is his chance to put the past behind him, but sometimes the future is even darker. Stewart falls in love with Novak and the love turns into a dark and twisted obsession that becomes deeper and deeper as the film progresses. When tragedy strikes, that is the end. Right? Not quite. An amazing screenplay and arguably Hitchcock&apos;s greatest directing venture make the film solid and Stewart&apos;s stunning performance raises the whole project to a classic level. Somewhat ignored around the awards circuit in 1958, but ages beautifully as the years go by. 5 stars out of 5."

            "reviewBody": "Fritz Lang&apos;s highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany, where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement, and ended in the United States in 1953 with the production of The Big Heat, a film noir classic. Perhaps his greatest film, M (Germany, 1931) forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir. Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones. \n\nEven though M was Lang&apos;s (and Germany&apos;s) first sound film, many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late 1920&apos;s. While most early &quot;talkies&quot; return films to their static, visually monotonous, stage- imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium, M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous, off-screen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue. The film&apos;s editing, particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting, also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling. Of course, many of the film&apos;s sound effects are also imaginative and memorable, none more so than the compulsive whistling of the film&apos;s central character, the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert (magnificently played by Peter Lorre). \n\nSound is also an important contributor to M&apos;s rich and influential use of off screen space. One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster, creepily intoning to his next victim, Elsie Beckmann, &quot;You have a very pretty ball.&quot; Not only is Beckert&apos;s shadow a bow toward Lang&apos;s expressionist artistic roots, but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image - that is, among us, the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuous-appearing, albeit monstrous, member. Another example of Lang&apos;s use of off-screen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsie&apos;s absence from them: an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table, the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsie&apos;s mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughter&apos;s arrival, the attic play area that awaits Elsie&apos;s return from school. Most memorable of all - and most often alluded to visually in other films - is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckert&apos;s assault and murder of the innocent child, representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsie&apos;s ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame. Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated images.\n\nBeyond its technical brilliance, the keys to M&apos;s lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckert&apos;s twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and &quot;trial.&quot; Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer, Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath. Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clear-cut. To be sure, the gut-reaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who, beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry, capture Beckert and bring him to a mock- formal trial whose conclusion is foregone. Like many in America today, Beckert&apos;s accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the &quot;monster&quot; in the surest way possible: a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible. \n\nConsidering the heinousness of Beckert&apos;s crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again, this emotional response is hard to resist. Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism - quite the contrary. Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckert&apos;s unkempt &quot;court appointed&quot; defense attorney and Beckert&apos;s own impassioned monologue, Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others (guilty or not) in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in 1930s Germany. That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks, dresses, and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident. Moreover, the letter &quot;M&quot; chalked on Beckert&apos;s back by one of his pursuers not only stands for &quot;murderer&quot; but also alludes to God&apos;s marking of Cain. While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil, it in fact represents God&apos;s warning to Cain&apos;s flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance, but to leave justice in God&apos;s hands. Translated into secular terms (and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame), God&apos;s hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert &quot;in the name of the Law.&quot;",

It is impossible I think to go through it without being brought to tears at one point or another. You also feel like screaming at some characters sometimes - &quot;what are you doing? Open your eyes! Listen!&quot; But the great thing is you always understand where each character is coming from- you might not agree with their actions, but nothing they do feels forced or unrealistic. Mikkelsen is amazing in this. I had seen him in a few movies before, and always thought highly of him, but here he is just incredible. It&apos;s a tough subject matter, and the movie does not shy away from it, but at the same time it is not vulgar or &quot;in your face&quot;, it&apos;s tactful. I really loved it.",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it&apos;s cracked up to be... I must say, it&apos;s great. The plot is great, and the way it&apos;s told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won&apos;t reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I&apos;ve seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can&apos;t praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It&apos;s only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn&apos;t move at all. When there weren&apos;t great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn&apos;t seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can&apos;t do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I&apos;m writing this, it&apos;s #11. That&apos;s pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven&apos;t seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don&apos;t let the fact that it&apos;s old and black &amp; white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10",

Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness/banality of media, among many other things.\n\nThe subtleties of the text are communicated, first and foremost, by superb acting.  The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are all revelatory.  In particular, I was knocked out by Burstyn, who is almost comically pathetic in the beginning, but who manages by the end to convey her character&apos;s utter devastation in the truest, most heartbreaking manner imaginable.  The others are absolutely perfect as well; I was simply astonished by Leto and especially Wayans (may he eschew &quot;scary movies&quot; forevermore).  Connelly has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, with opportunity and motivation galore to go over the top, and she delivers not a single false note throughout.\n\nMy only real quibbles with the movie have to do with certain instances of the split-screen and jump-cut techniques, which struck me as somewhat gimmicky and repetitious, respectively.  That being said, overall the style of the film is impressive and appropriate.   The cinematography is beautifully conceived and executed, and the score is every bit as haunting as the performances (thanks largely to the work of the Kronos Quartet).\n\nIn sum, regardless of whether or not the subject matter itself shocks you, this movie will put the viewer through the proverbial wringer.  Give it a chance, and you will connect with the characters and then witness their destruction (spiritual and otherwise).  It is a punishing but unforgettable experience.  I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;d necessarily recommend it or not; it all depends on your personal tolerance level with regard to an unflinching portrayal of human nature and behavior at their most extreme and, ultimately, tragic.  For my part, while I don&apos;t expect to watch this film very often in the future, I&apos;m sure glad it&apos;ll be on the shelf.",

A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.\n\nStir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain.&quot;\n\nThere&apos;s not a misstep in the movie&apos;s entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (&quot;She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!&quot;) and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (&quot;Fit as a Fiddle,&quot; &quot;Good Mornin&apos;&quot;).\n\nNot only that, but there&apos;s not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to &quot;You Were Meant for Me.&quot; Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.\n\nGreat stuff!\n\nIf you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven&apos;t seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won&apos;t regret it!\n\nPS: In the &quot;rent-this-too&quot; category, if you&apos;ve seen and love &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain,&quot; check out &quot;The Band Wagon.&quot; It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!"

            "reviewBody": "Its Hitch&apos;s most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else&apos;s crime.\n\nI&apos;ve finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront.  Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!\n\nIf you said to Hitchcock &quot;as if he&apos;d keep driving&quot; or &quot;as if she&apos;d do that&quot; - he would just laugh at you and say you&apos;ve missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you&apos;ll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone&apos;s been stabbed.\n\nIt flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.\n\nA succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann&apos;s essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.\n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "Very nicely crafted science fiction love story. More of an experience than a film.\n\nWhat? Sci Fi? Well yes. A simple science fiction device, memory erasure, is the vehicle for this beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and directed love fable. The fact that this is a good film does not disqualify it from the sci fi genre. In fact, would-be sci fi writers and film-makers should take note of this.\n\nBut Eternal Sunshine is a love story first and last, in all respects. The characters are what John Irving would call &quot;L.A. dysfunctional&quot;, although they don&apos;t live in L.A. Carrey and Winslet are deeply insecure people with little going for them but good looks (which they try to disguise), fairly sweet dispositions, and a desire for companionship. They meet on Valentine&apos;s Day in Montauk, where they have both seemingly traveled &apos;on a lark&apos;, and the entire experience of the film seems to derail from this point forward. Chronological, linear story-telling becomes impossible because the characters are having their memories erased in order to assuage the pain of their separation. No spoilers, so let me stop right there.\n\nIf I have made Eternal Sunshine seem like it might be too much of a challenge or too disturbing for an evening&apos;s light entertainment, be not afraid. Certainly there are occasional disturbing elements, and the characters themselves are all neurotic enough to have walked off the street and onto the screen. But the film is so artistically rendered, and so well thought-out that what could have been a nightmare really becomes a fantastic post-modern love fable. It&apos;s also one of those great films that becomes predictable after a while, but is so delightfully portrayed and satisfying that it does not matter.\n\nThe acting is exceptionally good. I would expect nothing else from this cast. Winslet is especially remarkable for her ability to play a young North East American better than most American actresses could. How this genius has been passed up in each of her 4 Oscar nominations to date is inexplicable. Carrey&apos;s talent is undeniable, though I dislike many of the films he chooses to take on. His performance here is easily as good as his award-worthy performances in the Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and Man on the Moon.\n\nWe spend a lot of time inside people&apos;s heads in this film, yet the camera never becomes a member of the cast as it does in films like &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. I can pay no higher compliment to the production team. This is a very difficult thing to accomplish, and it is done with flawless simplicity in Eternal Sunshine. This film has just joined Shakespeare in Love, Wild at Heart, and Brokeback Mountain among my favorite all-time love stories. This is the first Michel Gondry film I have seen. I am going to make sure it is not the last.",

When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer he realizes that he has been petty much dead his whole life, and searches desperately for away to live again.\n\nThis is Akira Kurosawa&apos;s masterpiece, yes, even better than Rashomon and The Seven Samauri. It is a perfect true story of everybody&apos;s life- how we don&apos;t even realize we have it until we know it will be over in a short while. Watanabi&apos;s quest for self-discovery is one of the greatest from any motion picture ever made. The all-too-true paradox is one to end all paradoxes- that Watanabi is dead, and had been all his life, until he realized he was sick, which is when he began living for the first time. Takashi Shimura, the actor best known for his role as the wise, bald-headed Samauri in The Seven Samauri, and the professor out of the early Godzilla films, plays Watanabi perfectly- in my mind, it&apos;s one of the greatest film performances of all time. \n\nNot everyone will love this movie. It was made a long time ago, the main character is an old fogey, it has subtitles, and it&apos;s pretty long. Many people today, especially young kids, would find it boring. Well, let &apos;em. There&apos;s no need to worry about them, they&apos;ll always have Pirates of the Carribbean, they&apos;ll always have The Matrix. Leave Ikiru and films like it to the true lovers of cinema.",

            "reviewBody": "The Italian neo-realist film movement began around the end of WWII with Roberto Rossellini&apos;s OPEN CITY in 1946.  It is defined and encapsulated by this striking film directed by Vittorio De Sica.  THE BICYCLE THIEF is the best of a group of films that depicted the hardship and despair that Europeans, specifically Italians, went through after the death and destruction of the war.  The economy was horrible, and the towns and cities were half-destroyed and decaying.  Rome is the location for THE BICYCLE THIEF and De Sica shoots the city in grainy black and white with non-professional actors to get a simple, yet unbearingly emotional point across.  A simple thing such as a bike can be someone&apos;s entire world at that time and losing it means doing something irrational or perhaps necessary.\n\nThe lead in the film is played by Lamberto Maggiorani who seems to be a very good actor.  He is not an actor, however, and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically.  Maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. His job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over Rome.  He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him.  Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city, a sign of joy to some, a representation of their own lowly status to others.\n\nWhen the bicycle is actually stolen, the &quot;title&quot; character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son (Enzo Staiola), a little kid with so much acting ability, you swear this must be a documentary.  A grueling search throughout Rome has the essential parts of the movie, because we see up close the actual people and places the neo-realist film movement came to represent.  It is a small, sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live.  The father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son.  Will he do the honorable thing or will he do what his mind and heart know is only possible? These are the tense moments of the film&apos;s climax.\n\nThere is a lot of THE BICYCLE THIEF in Benigni&apos;s LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and some obvious comparisons have been drawn because of the father-son relationship. They are worthy of comparison and have equal artistic prowess.  What is different about THIEF is the level of intensity maintained throughout.  I felt the key element was the music by Alessandro Cicognini, a simple horn that plays so tragically that it is a main character in the picture.  What De Sica does here, as well as other neo-realist directors (Rossellini, Fellini), is create for American audiences a powerful counterpoint to what we are used to.  An honest, non-corporate portrait of the struggle for life and self-respect.  THE BICYCLE THIEF is one of the finest films ever made.\n\nRATING: 10 of 10",

            "reviewBody": "Sweeping, epic and literate version of British adventurer and soldier T E Lawrence&apos;s experiences in Arabia during the First World War. Lawrence, miraculously well played by Peter O&apos;Toole, &quot;went native&quot; when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness&apos;s Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence&apos;s efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient.\n\nLawrence became an inspirational warlord whose neutral presence amongst the Arab tribes, lead by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn, amongst others, served to glue together shifting and uneasy alliances. As well as wrestling with himself, with his own demons, and with the cruel desert environment, the Englishman was also faced with culture clashes which pitted not only the imperialists against the indigenous populations, but also the mercenary practices of the Arab guerillas against the discipline of the British army. In the end, Lawrence himself does not know which side he is on, nor which party he belongs to. Set against a backdrop of the Arabian desert, the nomadic allies under Lawrence&apos;s direction, attack and disrupt the Turks&apos; efforts to maintain control of the territory, whilst the elephant - the British army and its heavy guns under General Jack Hawkins - pushes ever deeper into the area: not until his job is done does Lawrence learn that the French and British governments have carved up the middle-east between them and that the battle-lines for the 21st century are already being drawn.\n\nScripted by the inimitable Robert Bolt and directed by David Lean, Lawrence of Arabia is one of those films without a weakness, despite drawing complaints for its near four hour length. The dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack and especially direction are superlative; likewise the supporting actors. But it is O&apos;Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut; he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie, but is well worth the ride and will, by the bye, provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics. \n\nOne of the best films ever made.",

Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award:\n\n This man is the true embodiment of the &quot;American Dream&quot;: Having grown up in poverty and misery and virtually without parents (without a father and with insane mother), moving to America with basically nothing but his ability to speak English (in the era of the silent movies), this man manages to establish his own film company (United Artists) and becomes one of the creators of Hollywood. He produces, directs, writes, plays the leading role and composes the music for his movies. He is the creator of the most famous movie image on the earth-the Little Tramp. As you all probably know I am talking about sir Charles Spencer Chaplin. \n\nThere are attempts, sometimes I read, to make Buster Keaton candidate for the Chaplin&apos;s throne. Well, I won&apos;t comment on that for I am not familiar with Keaton&apos;s work; I grew up with Chaplin so you could say I am being biased, however I would mention only one fact here: the only time the two meet on the screen is in a Chaplin&apos;s movie &quot;Limelight.&quot; I think this says a lot.\n\nWhy did I choose the movie &quot;The Kid&quot; as a podium for my tribute to the great Charlie? I have to say I like all of his movies, mistake, I love all of his movies, but this one is the true purl in his work to me. I don&apos;t think of any other movie, not only Chaplin&apos;s, that made me cry, I mean really cry, and laugh, I mean really laugh, like &quot;The Kid.&quot; The closest I can think of now is another Chaplin&apos;s masterpiece &quot;City Lights&quot; but unlike the later one in the former one that is only him, the tramp, and the kid; and everything is silent. Think about it: the movie making at its purest.\n\n I don&apos;t know whether I could make my point with this review-probably not. There are not enough words to describe the respect and gratitude I feel towards Chaplin. To me he is simply the greatest filmmaker of all time."

However I have seen a lot of action and war films, and this one, to an individual who never went to war, seems the most true-to-life, taken as a whole. This IS how you have to look at this film, incidentally; trying to break it down into two or three parts and say which was better is missing the point of the film, I think. \n\nIn the same way that &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was an anti-drug film that did not gloss over anything, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is (for me) an anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war and the potential for violence within almost all people, especially those trained, conditioned, even twisted, into military roles, without preaching even a single time. Less allegory and more applicability! Wonderful! \n\nThe camera work was superb. I felt like I was walking through the movie with the Marines, from the barracks to the battlefield scenes.\n\nI have seen others criticize this film for the voice over, but I felt that it was used sparingly, and was helpful, not overdone. The narrator doesn&apos;t say anything that seems out-of-place.\n\nOthers have commented on the music, the acting, and so on, so I won&apos;t add my repetitive comments, except that the drill sergeant is perfect!\n\nThe combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined &quot;hours of boredom, seconds of terror&quot; feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL.\n\n10 out of 10, perfect."

            "reviewBody": "A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.\n\nA Canadain-Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son &amp; daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. As we follow their search, flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother.\n\nThere are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in Incendies. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East, this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. It is the third great film (and arguably the best)that I&apos;ve seen on this topic after Waltz with Bashir and Lebanon. All of these are essential viewing.",

A compelling narrative based on true story with a powerful message for women&quot; My rating- 4.5/5 (Movie of the year and don&apos;t miss this flick) \n\nPositives- 1.)Direction and screenplay- Direction and screenplay didn&apos;t bore us and we were glued to the seats as it was so engaging and entertaining.\n\n2.)Aamir khan , Zaira (young Geeta), Fathima (geeta) , suhani (young babitha), sanya(babitha) and fathima (mother)- Everyone&apos;s performance was excellent. Amir&apos;s hardwork and dedication for this role can be seen through his performance. He once again proved to be Mr perfectionist. All girls who acted as daughters were very good and they portrayed their roles without any problems.\n\n3.)Songs and bg score- Special mention for title song. Title song was great and suited the movie well. Hats off to Pritam and he once again proved that he is the best music director of bollywood.\n\n4.) Cinematography and edits- Cinematographer captured wrestling scenes very well and edits of certain scenes were good.\n\n5.)Strong message for women \n\nNegatives- (NO NEGATIVES) \n\nIs it a must watch? Yes!!! and watch it in theaters to get the feel.\n\nOverall- This is the best Christmas treat for everyone from dangal team. This has Aamir Khan&apos;s best performance till date. And the major one is that it has strong message for women. Yes its a must watch movie and don&apos;t miss this flick!! My rating- 4.5/5 (Movie of the year and don&apos;t miss this movie) \n\nFor more reviews go to- ridinbal movie reviews.

This isn&apos;t the laugh out loud comedy of Jim Carrey or the Farrelly brothers, but a subtle, nuanced comedy about two people who have both been jaded in love and yet continue to hope again and again that it will someday work out for them -- mainly because despite the unlikeable things they do, they are both basically decent, nice people. Flawed and even weak at times, but good people. This is a movie that doesn&apos;t just make it you laugh, it makes you think. A rare find indeed.",

I think it&apos;s a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as &quot;cheesy.&quot;\n\nI read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film&apos;s snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That&apos;s not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,\n\nFor a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.\n\nMacMurray&apos;s narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.\n\nStanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.\n\nThis film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, &quot;Body Heat,&quot; starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one.",

            "reviewBody": "Fritz Lang&apos;s groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema. How can a movie that&apos;ll soon turn 80 years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages. The world has been divided into two main categories: thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category, you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if you&apos;re a worker, your life isn&apos;t worth a penny, and you&apos;re doomed to perilous labor underground. The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil, so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself. It&apos;s essential viewing, anyway! &quot;Metropolis&quot; is a very demanding film-experience and definitely not always entertaining. But, as it is often the case with silent-cinema classics, the respect and admiration you&apos;ll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoyment-aspect. Fritz&apos; brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to re-create a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines. Many supposedly &apos;restored&apos; versions have been released over the years (in 1984 and 2002, for example) but the 1926-version is still the finest in my opinion, even though that one already isn&apos;t as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it. &quot;Metropolis&quot; perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made. &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; owe their existence (or at least their power) to it.",

The writer-director says he wrote this with Anthony Hopkins, who was 81, in mind. The movie has a number of well established actors but the story&apos;s impact depends on Hopkins and he achieves this as very few might be able to do.\n\nUsually movies dealing with aging and dementia depict it from the points of view of all the others around, friends, family members, medical personnel. This does the opposite, it depicts it from the point of view of the afflicted person. As such I found myself totally confused after about 20 minutes but eventually understood why it had to be this way. We are seeing what Anthony (character&apos;s name) sees and experiences, the confusion as to where he is and his failure to recognize people he knows.\n\nIn many ways this is a hard movie to watch because we know people who have gone through dementia and its inevitable end, or know people who are in the early stages of it. For that reason my wife chose not to watch this movie.\n\nFor the subject matter it is a very good movie."

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;m an Iranian, but I&apos;ve never been interested in Iranian cinema. I only watch Iranian films when they win awards or receive international recognition. I&apos;m a fan of Kiarostami and Majidi, but I can&apos;t really say that I like all of their films. I watched Farhady&apos;s previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event. At the time, I believed this to have been the cause of this director&apos;s success. Watching Nader and Simin, however, proved that I was terribly mistaken.\n\nAsghar Farhady&apos;s obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The life-like depiction of the Iranian courtroom (which is in no way impartial) places the audience in the Judge&apos;s seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up his/her mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay, I&apos;m almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life, because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events, so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.\n\nDespite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture (the sanctity of Family, faith, commitment towards parents and married life), I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke (although I&apos;m pretty sure it won&apos;t be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons).\n\nAfter seeing About Elly, I thought Farhady&apos;s success was just a one-time fling, but coming out of the theater, having watched Nader and Simin, I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites.",

Travis&apos;s loneliness is a hyper representation of the same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times in different measures. It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese delivers it like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenith of his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we, well, we&apos;re the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiar at the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to life with the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I&apos;m sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his &quot;You looking at me&quot; became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does.",

The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government&apos;s attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can&apos;t be denied. \n\nEqually excellent to the film&apos;s content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick&apos;s perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick&apos;s use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist&apos;s behavior and the government&apos;s policies. \n\nA Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It&apos;s a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers.",

            "reviewBody": "Johnny Hooker and Luther Coleman are `grifters&apos; or confidence tricksters in 1930s Chicago. Unknown to them, however, one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan, and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing, but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner&apos;s death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan&apos;s pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff, and together they come up with an elaborate plan, not only to cheat Lonnegan, but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity; until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.\n\nCrime thrillers set during this period are normally associated with the classic `film noir&apos; style, with its dark, brooding, cynical atmosphere. In `The Sting&apos;, however, George Roy Hill deliberately sets out to create a very different mood. The style is almost the exact opposite of film noir. The acting is heavily stylised (as is the scenery), and the division of the film into sections with titles such as `The Hook&apos; or `The Line&apos; is reminiscent of the formal division of a stage play into acts and scenes. The film is not in black-and-white but in bright colour, and the mood, far from being heavy and brooding, is light and cheerful. Scott Joplin&apos;s music, although written slightly earlier than the period in which the film is set, fits this mood perfectly. The major actors all play their parts perfectly- Robert Shaw as the glowering, menacing Lonnegan, Robert Redford as the young, idealistic Hooker (insofar as a con-man can be said to be an idealist), and Paul Newman as the older, more experienced and laid-back Gondorff. There are also good contributions from Charles Durning as the corrupt policement Lieutenant Snyder and Robert Earl Jones as Luther.\n\nDespite the cheerful mood, the film has serious undertones in keeping with its themes of revenge and murder. I am not usually a great admirer of what are known as `heist&apos; or `caper&apos; movies, as I feel that too often they glamourise crime and dishonesty. `The Sting&apos;, however, is different. Hooker and Gondorff live in a world where the moral order has broken down. The police are hopelessly corrupt- Snyder, the one representative we see of the forces of law and order, is on Lonnegan&apos;s payroll. There is no chance of Hooker getting justice for his friend&apos;s murder through the normal channels; the only way in which this can be achieved is to go outside the law. Where the police are crooked, only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and, moreover, because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan&apos;s wallet. An excellent film, which well deserved its Academy Award. 9/10.",

            "reviewBody": "&quot;A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.&quot; -Mark Twain\n\n&apos;Classic&apos; seems to be the word used to describe &quot;Scarface&quot;, Brian DePalma&apos;s 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among Florida&apos;s drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film &apos;an epic gangster classic&apos; or &apos;eptiome of gangster films.&apos; When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.\n\nFirst off, the film is about a Cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma&apos;s directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. &apos;Tragedy&apos; would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it&apos;s drug usage, it&apos;s violence, it&apos;s dialog, totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn&apos;t make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.\n\nNext on, the film is an adult drama. It is not a &apos;gangster film&apos;. It has it&apos;s share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. It&apos;s not like &quot;Aliens&quot;- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. \n\nThis being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn&apos;t think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma&apos;s direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping&apos; fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in &quot;Grease 2&quot; she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony&apos;s sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina&apos;s torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. \n\nThis reviewer learned one main thing when watching &quot;Scarface&quot; for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of Bailey&apos;s on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real &quot;Scarface.&quot;",

            "reviewBody": "Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, &quot;SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND!  WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!&quot; What do you think would happen?  Snatch is what happens.\n\nSnatch is a confusing, twisting, crazy movie.  Let me repeat that.  This movie is crazy!  Imagine the Mr. Toad&apos;s Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid, and this is what you get my friend.  Believe it or not, this mass confusion and complete insanity is very, very entertaining.\n\nThe movie has it&apos;s problems.  First off, for those of you who have seen Snatch&apos;s predecessor, (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you know that Guy Richie (the writer and director of both films) has a very music-video style as far as the camera angles, movements, and cinematography goes.  The strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that I noticed people walking out of the theater.  I was also turned off by this madness. However, most of this insane crap gets over within the first hour, so it doesn&apos;t last.\n\nIf any of you people out there loved Lock Stock as much as I did, do yourself a favor and see this movie as fast as you can.  Snatch is a bit more serious than Lock Stock, but when it&apos;s funny, you&apos;ll laugh till your lungs burst.  It was nice to see Vinnie Jones, who was Big Chris in the last movie, return as the same basic character (only now named Bullet Tooth Tony) and doing the same &quot;slamming victim&apos;s head in a car door&quot; act again.  The performances were just as great as Lock Stock, with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack.  I was disappointed to see that Bendicio Del Toro didn&apos;t have a bigger role.  I was expecting him to be a lead character, but he&apos;s not.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you have never seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie&apos;s style.  I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction (unlike most people), but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp.  That means if you liked Pulp, you will most likely like Snatch and Lock, Stock.  If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock, you have deprived your life of culture.\n\n9/10",

            "reviewBody": "Short analysis on Jean-Pierre Jeunet&apos;s Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Am\u00e9lie Poulain\n\nFor 20 years Jean-Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Jean-Pierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Am\u00e9lie Poulain. But it&apos;s popularity was even a surprise to Jean-Pierre Jeunet himself as he once stated: `I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection (USA 1997) to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Am\u00e9lie Poulain&apos;, obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn&apos;t win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.\n\nI consider Jean-Pierre Jeunet&apos;s film as a masterpiece. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography, the music, the story, but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one-hour and comfortable chair - our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off, we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time, to experience something totally different and yet, we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream, I will never forget.\n\nJean-Pierre Jeunet and his camera man, Bruno Delbonnel, wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green, sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou (Am\u00e9lie Poulain), mostly wears either red or green dresses, as well as the housekeeper (Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace, concierge), and Am\u00e9lie&apos;s mother (Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin) in the beginning of the film. When Am\u00e9lie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV, there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Am\u00e9lie&apos;s apartment for example is almost completely red, the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly, I haven&apos;t noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.\n\nThe atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful, yet at the same time sad - slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.\n\nCamera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Am\u00e9lie&apos;s mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Am\u00e9lie&apos;s father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Am\u00e9lie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car. Am\u00e9lie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning almost 180\u00b0 around her to show her hold Nino&apos;s red bag that he lost. When Am\u00e9lie sits in front of the station, we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome, not only from a technical point of view, but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.\n\nAudrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can&apos;t imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character, she lives it. It&apos;s wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job, although I want to mention the scene when Am\u00e9lie&apos;s mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme close-up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director&apos;s choice, so I don&apos;t hold her responsible for that.\n\n Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when Jean-Pierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Am\u00e9lie&apos;s pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer&apos;s door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key&apos;s silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn&apos;t been used very often in the film, except for showing Am\u00e9lie&apos;s heart going faster and the old, blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Am\u00e9lie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old&apos;s man face, a close-up of Am\u00e9lie&apos;s hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere.\n\n Anyway, Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Am\u00e9lie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long, but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions, where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Am\u00e9lie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal, but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minute-rescue, no time pressure, no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.\n\nIn my opinion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography, the special effects or any other technical characteristics, but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story, humour, and emotion."

The performances throughout are stunning, especially that of Gregory Peck (Harper Lee was so impressed she gave him her late father&apos;s pocket watch, a prop he uses in the film, to keep). This film will make anyone think hard about how they treat others and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. It isn&apos;t necessary to have read the book before seeing this film but it might be advisable. This is one of the classic films of its generation and very few films of nowadays come close to matching it either. A real must-see.",

The story was even better then the previous two combined.\n\nI went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood. The mix of humour and emotion mad this movie one of the best I have ever seen, including big ones like Godfather and Shawshank.\n\nThis movie is both hard and easy to review because you try to look at the down sides to the movie but the hard part is that there isn&apos;t any.

            "reviewBody": "Italian director Sergio Leone changed the face of the Western genre in 1964 when he introduced what would be known as the &quot;Spaghetti Western&quot; with the brilliant &quot;Per un Pugno di Dollari&quot; (&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;). Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone&apos;s westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. &quot;Per Qualche Dollaro in pi\u00f9&quot; (&quot;For a few dollars more&quot;), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time.\n\n&quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, the second in the so-called &quot;Dollars trilogy&quot; (a group of films by Leone with the same style), is the story of two different yet very similar men, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named &quot;El Indio&quot; (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8). An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward, but are these two killers after &quot;Indio&quot; for the same reason? \n\nWritten by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself, the film&apos;s main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns, both Manco and the Colonel have well-developed attitudes, motivations and purposes; they are neither completely good nor completely bad, they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm, it is probably the best structured of the &quot;Trilogy&quot; and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.\n\nStylistically, the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone&apos;s previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone&apos;s realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre&apos;s conventions. &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; is a violent tale of two hunters, and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths, the Westerns never felt this real.\n\nClint Eastwood&apos;s super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film, as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world, however, the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever, Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting, giving life to Leone&apos;s brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past, he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves.\n\n&quot;Per qualche dollaro in pi\u00f9&quot; is a near flawless movie, as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It&apos;s only minor problem may be the dubbing, but fortunately, it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn&apos;t hurt the film. \n\nFans will always argue about which of the three films of the &quot;trilogy&quot; is the best, and while personally I prefer &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; over this one, it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one. A real classic that changed the face of Western as we knew it. 10/10",

            "reviewBody": "What a wonderful film. For those who have not watched any films from India or heard of Ray, I strongly recommend it. Full of sadness, hope, innocence, and despair, it is an emotionally evocative portrait of the life of an Indian family, their trials, and their courage and persistence throughout. They go on, not because they are exceptional, but because they must, because they are human.\n\nRay does a masterful job of capturing the simple joys of childhood, and the ambitions and dreams which make us all human, regardless of where we are. Simple scenes such as a disfigured elderly woman seated on a porch, singing of her approaching death, are very moving. I have never seen the basic elements of life treated with such an incisive yet soft touch as Ray has in this film. It is wonderful to watch in comparison to the broad writing strokes and vulgar generalities of most directing and writing today. At the risk of sounding trite, this is a film which is not merely entertainment or art, but one which reaches into your heart and makes a place for itself there. It belongs there."

            "reviewBody": "Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone \u2013 young &quot;wilderness explorer&quot; Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.\n\nThe fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.\n\nComing off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.\n\nWhat makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a &quot;bird&quot; named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story \u2013 the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl&apos;s backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.\n\nBut the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun \u2013 something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up&apos;s favour.\n\nBut of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl&apos;s facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).\n\nI cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.\n\n10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. \n\nI loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy&apos;s dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit &amp; charm along with Indy&apos;s usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; isn&apos;t by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix&apos; laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.\n\nThis is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg&apos;s output: A young Indiana &quot;beginning&quot; his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat &quot;You lost today kid, but that doesn&apos;t mean you have to like it.&quot; and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. \n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There&apos;s a bit of kissing/banter, and it&apos;s implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there&apos;s ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn&apos;t need another sequel after third release. There&apos;s nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy&apos;s Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it&apos;s up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.\n\nThe chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

The human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro&apos;s character (Neil). His personal conflicts are as strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. This is the magic of this film and only two fantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally. Congratulations to Val Kilmer that shined and performed exceptionally well under the huge shadow of Pacino and De Niro. A must see !",

            "reviewBody": "Give a collection of great actors a great story to work with and you are likely to end up with something rather special. Such is the case with L.A. Confidential. The boldface names jump off the page...Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell and, in his first big-time role, Guy Pearce. And none of these big names are just mailing it in, here to collect a paycheck. They&apos;re all on top of their games, undoubtedly helped to no small extent by the wonderfully nuanced and utterly intriguing story.\n\nThis story takes place in 1950s Los Angeles but this is a side of L.A. most people don&apos;t get to see. Behind all the Hollywood glamour L.A. has a seamy side which will be the focus of this tale. At the heart of the movie are three cops who ostensibly are supposed to be working together but who go about the business of dispensing justice in very different ways. Crowe plays aggressive hothead Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes, who takes more pride in his work as an adviser on a popular television cop drama than he does in his actual police work. And Pearce plays Edmund Exley, a young up-and-comer in the department who plays things by the book. As we will soon see Exley is rather unique in an LAPD which believes in doing whatever is necessary to bring the guilty to justice. Even if it means becoming a little guilty themselves.\n\nThe movie really begins to move forward with a massacre at a coffee shop. It seems a pretty cut and dried case but initial appearances can be deceiving. Soon White, Vincennes and Exley will find themselves caught up in a maze of lies, deception and mystery. It will be a great test for these very different men as it appears they may well need each other&apos;s unique talents to solve this puzzle. And quite the elaborate puzzle it is. One important piece is Lynn Bracken, a high class call girl played by Basinger. Tying together many of this complex story&apos;s strands is gossip writer Sid Hudgens who is played with appropriate sleaziness by DeVito. And in the background the whole time is the somewhat mysterious Captain Dudley Smith, played by Cromwell. Here is a man who believes in bringing the guilty to justice by any means necessary. That&apos;s all well and good if you know who the guilty are but in L.A. Confidential you&apos;re never quite sure who to believe. The viewer is guessing right along with the investigators on the screen. And in the end it all comes together and pays off brilliantly.\n\nL.A. Confidential is first and foremost a great story, with many fascinating twists and turns along the way. The film also serves as a showcase for some of this generation&apos;s finest acting talents. Each of the main characters is wonderfully unique and each of the actors involved does a terrific job in bringing those characters to life. These are complex characters in a complex tale. It&apos;s so involved that the acting had to be stellar if this film was going to work and none of the stars disappoint. Terrific storytelling brought to life by a collection of inspired performances makes L.A. Confidential an absolute winner.",

            "reviewBody": "Ran is probably cinema&apos;s greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic, ironically coming from an oriental film-maker. Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare&apos;s King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. \n\nThe story focuses on a senile warlord, who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter, ergo he renounces to his three sons, hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee, but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son&apos;s audacious defiance, he tries to console him, only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son&apos;s impertinence and censure, he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read, for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran. \n\nThe brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can&apos;t help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy, deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude, though doesn&apos;t feature an utterance of even a single syllable, the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa&apos;s brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis. \n\nA must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema. Highly recommended: 10/10.",

Other films may be more profound, or their imagery more groundbreaking, but this one is so tightly constructed that nothing - not a frame, word, or gesture - is extraneous.\n\nToshiro Mifune, one of the world&apos;s most charismatic actors, is perfection as a tough loner of a samurai who takes it upon himself to clean up a town corrupted by two gambling clans. Swirling through and around him is a story that is both technically flawless and profoundly moving.\n\nKurosawa meticulously infuses every detail with meaning; there&apos;s a purpose behind every shot, and aspiring directors should pay close attention (why is the camera slightly tilted? why are there concubines in the background?). His economy of style was never more amazing; watch as the samurai rides into town, and the director establishes the atmosphere with exactly one jaw-dropping shot. And the story is equally well-crafted, with no plot holes and no inconsistencies.\n\nA wonderful tale that rolls beautifully from start to finish. See it, see it, see it!!"

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve got to admit, I only really watched this movie because of the (many, many) references in Brooklyn 99. And I got thinking, is Die Hard really that good? So, I gave it a watch, guided by the many, many Jake Peralta jokes that I had grown accustomed to. And I&apos;ve got to say, this is the action movie that paved the way for all future action movies.\n\nI usually have an aversion to Christmas movies as they all tend to turn into cheesy rom-coms but this was pretty awesome. And I think the reason for that is because that even though it was Christmassy where it mattered, the plot didn&apos;t completely revolve around it.\n\nI&apos;ve got to admit, most of it was guns and explosions and there was very little plot to go off of besides a pretty traditional three-act structure, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. And you know it&apos;s a good movie when about 90% of it was guns and blood and explosions and the other 10% was Bruce Willis saying badass things and crawling through vents in an ever-disintegrating tank top, and you stilled enjoyed it.\n\nThere was never a still moment in this movie, but unlike most times, where I just end up getting bored of the CGI-fest explosions, I was actually pretty captivated through the entire runtime. I&apos;m actually really pleasantly surprised. The ending is predictable, but it&apos;s nice. Not all movies have to be intellectual masterpieces. Sometimes you just need to switch your brain of a little and watch Bruce Willis kick ass.\n\nSo, Jake of B99 was right. I mean, it&apos;s badass, Bruce Willis has the best one-liners, you have cool explosions. There&apos;s not too much more I could say about this movie. Yippie kayak, other buckets.\n\n-Sasha.",

Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley&apos;s road trip through the south during the 60&apos;s, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don&apos;s perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it&apos;s funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!",

            "reviewBody": "Now here is a novel idea, making a movie from the &quot;enemy&apos;s&quot; point of view, attaching a human face to probably the most notorious institute of evil in human history. Before watching this film, I had reservations over how much I would enjoy it and what I might gain from it. I was concerned that the film may be an attempt to show the human side of the Nazi party, to make us sympathetic not to their cause, but to their human nature. I had to think to myself, do I really want to attach a human element to people who history has painted as monsters? The film begins with Hitler recruiting Traudl Junge as a new secretary in 1942, from this point onwards the film is predominantly (but not entirely) seen through her eyes. This key scene at the beginning of the film shows how people reacted to their leader with fanatical loyalty, holding him high in reverence. This gives us a brief insight into the belief of his followers that what they were doing would lead them to a golden utopia, a better world. All to often in films concerning Nazi&apos;s, they are portrayed as evil personified, killing for killing&apos;s sake, being evil for the sake of being evil. What we get throughout this film is a more realistic viewpoint of people&apos;s attitudes. The people who followed Hitler may have no entirely agreed with everything he said, may have not hung on his every word, but believed that he would lead them to a greater future, as such they followed.\n\nBruno Ganz, does a magnificent job of playing one of history&apos;s most notorious and documented individuals. He plays the role as, what I feel, accurately and realistically as possible. He resists the temptation to play Hitler as an uber-evil super-villain, disregarding all life who opposes him and wiping out humans at a whim. He plays the roles as an ageing leader, loosing grip on his health, his sanity and his conquest. A man who was kind, considerate and caring to children, his dog and his civilian staff, but who also attempted to wipe out an entire race of people and was proud of himself for doing it. It shows a man willing to send young children into the street to resist enemy advancement, it shows a man who believes that the civilian population would not be evacuated, as it was their chance to rise up (women and children, the old and sick, un armed) and prove they deserved victory. This film raises the question, was Hitler an evil man who practised evil deeds through his beliefs? or were his evil deeds a result of his absolute pursuit of his beliefs? Watching Ganz&apos;s performance, you get the feeling all Hitler had left before he took his life, was his ideals (not that this is anything to be proud of). He had lost the war, he had lost the respect of several of his commanding officers and he had lost his grip on reality.\n\nThe film also shows Hitler&apos;s closest officers and staff, it shows how they react to the downfall. Some have blind and fanatical faith that Hitler will act as their saviour and devise a scheme to turn the battle around. Some accept that their leader has lost his grip, but follow with blind devotion anyway. Some are not so sure and see the cracks in the beliefs they were fighting for. The film shows these often horrifying moments and realisations in all to realistic detail.\n\nUltimately, Downfall shows the human and personal element of the end of the war for Hitler and the Nazis. It shows how real people, people who tell jokes, drink, socialise, listen to songs and dance, also followed national socialism with a devotion that drove them to do the terrible things they did. It shows how they did not believe what they were doing was wrong, in their minds they were paving the way for their glorious future. It also shows their fanatical devotion and blind faith in their goal, led to their downfall, both as a movement and as human beings.\n\nDownfall is an amazing and powerful film, documenting an unseen side of a major historical event. The film ends with video footage of the real Traudl Junge talking about her feelings towards the war and he involvement with the Nazis. She says that when she first became involved with the Nazis, she was in awe of their power and beliefs, she may have not agreed with everything they did, but what difference would her being involved or not make? She was ignorant to their deeds and as such held a clean conscience. Then she says has realised over time she had the power not to be ignorant to their deeds, that she should have stayed away from them, realising them for the evil that they were. I felt she was warning what ignorance can lead to, that no matter how tiny one person is in the scheme of things, it is no excuse to contribute towards the wrong cause.\n\nExcellent historical film, highly recommended.",

            "reviewBody": "THE definitive saga of backstage brouhaha ever dished out by Hollywood.  A triumph of screen-writing, never will one see such ripe, acrid dialogue spewed out like this again -- every indelible scene gloriously stained with classic one-liners.  An actress wanna-be looking for her big break carefully worms her way into the glamorous life of a legendary Broadway star, then tries to supplant her privately and professionally.\n\nA sterling, incandescent cast provides the fire and music to this concerto of theatre attitude.  Bette Davis knew she was handed a dream role when she was cast as Margo Channing, the indomitable diva caught up in the throes of mid-life crisis both on- and off-stage.  Not willing at all to deal with it tactfully, she makes life a living hell for anyone within knife-throwing distance.  This juicy, once-in-a-lifetime part turned Davis&apos; own flagging middle-aged career back on its feet, especially coming on the heels of one of her biggest &quot;dumps&quot; ever, &quot;Beyond the Forest.&quot;  Remarkable as it may seem, Bette was not the first choice here, replacing an injured Claudette Colbert.  With all due respect to Colbert, Bette Davis was BORN to play Margo Channing.  A mauling lioness one minute, a coy, declawed pussycat the next, Davis relishes every wickedly bitchy scene she gets to tear into. Yet in her more introspective moments, she evokes real sympathy for Margo (as only a true star can) especially when her character missteps.  It&apos;s a resounding victory for the Queen Bee in every way, shape and form.\n\nHer &quot;supporting cast&quot; also manage to create a buzz of excitement.  Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe, known for their relative blandness, are splendid here in their respective roles as queen bee&apos;s lover and playwright.  While Merrill&apos;s Bill Sampson tames Margo the woman with gutsy directness and virile passion, Marlowe&apos;s Lloyd Richards appeases Margo the star with flattery, great dialogue and a calm resolve.  Worth watching, then, are their fireworks scenes with Margo when intelligence and restraint no longer work.  Debonair George Sanders gives customary snob appeal and dry cynicism to his waspish, ultimately loathsome columnist Addison DeWitt, who swarms around Broadway&apos;s elite knowledgeable in the fact his lack of heart and poison pen yield exclusive rights and power.  The most sensitive and sensible one in the collective bunch, the one lacking a true stinger, is Karen Richards (played wonderfully by Celeste Holm), Margo&apos;s best friend and confidante, who finds herself caught between the queen and a hard place when she accidentally makes a pact with the devil.  Thelma Ritter couldn&apos;t be overlooked if she tried.  An inveterate scene-stealer, she weathers strong competition this time in a movie crammed with clever conversation and pungent zingers.  As coarse but well-meaning Birdie Coonan, a brash ex-vaudevillian now the queen&apos;s ever-loyal &quot;drone&quot;, Ritter&apos;s character properly handles her boss&apos;s antics with amusing grit and backbone.  On the periphery of this Broadway beehive is mop-faced Gregory Ratoff as an edgy, gullible, thick-accented producer, Marilyn Monroe as a hopelessly vacuous starlet, and Barbara Bates, as a novice schemer with a very bright future, all making their few scenes count -- especially Bates, who is forever enshrined in the film&apos;s stunning final shot.\n\nThe chief thorn in Margo&apos;s (and everybody&apos;s) side, and the other real star of this picture, is the queen&apos;s titular lady-in-waiting, Eve Harrington. As played by Anne Baxter, this role is probably the most delicate and difficult of all for the weight and believability of this drama falls squarely on her shoulders.  Unfairly overlooked all these years by the flashier posturings of Davis, Baxter does a beautiful job of drawing initial pathos then panic as she slowly unveils her own lethal stinger.  By film&apos;s end, Baxter is directly on par with her scenery-chewing co-star.  Killer to killer. Champion to champion.\n\nSix Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (also Mankiewicz) and Supporting Actor (George Sanders) went to this cinematic bon mot.  Had Bette Davis and Anne Baxter not competed as Best Actress (Baxter refused to place herself in the Supporting Actress category), it would have drummed up two more awards to be sure.\n\nDeveloping a faithful cult following over the years, this film deserves to be on everybody&apos;s &quot;top ten&quot; list.",

Some people though are knocking the ending, but again still praising the rest of the movie, and I&apos;d like to just say that the ending is just fine the way it is.  Yes, they had planned to have some big storming the castle ending to the film which may or may not have been hilarious; but, they ran out of money on the film (look at the use of coconuts, a real budget would have meant real horses).  The ending that all this is really just a fantasy (so to speak) about a fantasy saga actually is quite funny. Is does end abruptly, but even that is fine in the context of a wacky movie. Just enjoy it and don&apos;t harp on the fact that the ending doesn&apos;t fit the rest of the movie, it does if you let it."

What makes &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; different is two things: the strength of its comedy, and the presence of Marilyn Monroe, then at the height of stardom.\n\nLemmon and Curtis turn in admirable performances both as Joe and Jerry, and as Josephine and Daphne. Tony Curtis does Lemmon one better by creating a third identity, &quot;Junior&quot;, in order to woo Sugar Kane (Monroe).\n\nTying the pair&apos;s story into the Chicago Valentine&apos;s Day Massacre, where a gang war spilled over into a parking garage, leaving a number of people lined up against the wall and shot, is a deft touch (though the serious tone of these gang sequences contrasts sharply with the bulk of the movie).\n\nThe movie does an excellent job building the far-fetched stakes of the movie ever-higher, from their finding refuge from vengeful gangs in a women&apos;s jazz band, to their showdown in the Florida hotel, to the eventual revealing of Curtis&apos; and Lemmon&apos;s identities. The movie&apos;s surprisingly suggestive and risque content is at odds with the time frame of the movie, and even with the period of the movie&apos;s creation. The many smart double-entendres and plays on words are very well-written, and alternate between lowbrow and highbrow comedy,\n\nThe films only fault might be a couple of overlong musical numbers, performed either by the whole band or soloed by Sugar Kane. Though to be expected in a Marilyn Monroe film, these musical acts are literal &quot;show stoppers&quot; that bring the comedic momentum of the film to a screeching halt. However, it is easy to over look these minor defects in the movie as a whole, because by and large it is quite funny \u0096 no wonder it s considered a classic \u0096 and after all, &quot;nobody&apos;s perfect&quot;."

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan&apos;s previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won&apos;t give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect. \n\nWhat&apos;s impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking of taking their young kids along, think twice. When we left, a terrified 8-year-old boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of what&apos;s up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.\n\nOf the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses, Christian Bale convinces in his dual role, while Michael Caine as Alfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of taking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able support, as does Morgan Freeman. \n\nMost refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a way of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often adult source material in a way that, say, Daredevil, tried and failed to do (although the director&apos;s cut is better). If the Dark Knight doesn&apos;t return after this, there&apos;s no justice.",

            "reviewBody": "Ford, Hawks, Leone, Peckinpah, all of them big names who have defined the Western genre in one way or another across the history of cinema, transforming what started as low-budget action films into an art itself where the American Old West served as setting for tales of mythical heroism, classic tragedies, and legendary adventures. Actor and Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most knowledgeable artists about the Western genre, as his acting career began as the legendary &quot;Man With No Name&quot; in the Sergio Leone&apos;s Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. As a director, he somewhat continued this legacy through movies like &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot; and &quot;Pale Rider&quot;, but finally in 1992, Eastwood released what many consider his final ode to the Western, and his ultimate masterpiece of the genre: &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, an epic saga about the deconstruction of the Western myths.\n\nClint Eastwood himself plays William Munny, a former gunslinger who is now living a peaceful life as a farmer with his two children. However, life is very difficult for Munny&apos;s family, as since the death of his wife the family has been facing financial problems. One day a young man calling himself &quot;The Schofield Kid&quot; (Jaimz Woolvett) appears looking for Munny. The Kid tells Munny about a bounty offered in the town of Big Whisky, and offers him the chance to join him as hired gun and split the reward between them. While Munny&apos;s days as a murderer are in the past, he decides to join him after thinking about the farm&apos;s problems, but not without calling his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to join them. However, Munny&apos;s past as a notorious thief and murderer will return to haunt him in this last mission, as the Kid shows a true and honest admiration for Munny&apos;s fame as a gunslinger, even when Munny himself considers his past as villainous.\n\nWhile better known for his work in science fiction, David Webb Peoples&apos; screenplay proves to be a very accurate description of life in the American west, particularly concerning the aspects of the uses and abuses of violence in that era. It is in fact the use of violence what comes as the main theme of the story, as Munny is escaping from his past&apos;s violence while the Kid is eagerly awaiting the next chance to prove his masculinity by the use of violence. The duality between man and myth is explored not only via the relationship between the Kid and Munny, but also in the shape of a character who writes novels about the wild west, and sees the figure of the gunslinger as an idolized modern hero. Peoples&apos; screenplay is remarkably well written, as the many characters and their relationships are exhaustively explored, resulting in a character driven revisionism of the western, that in many ways criticizes the genre&apos;s origins as violent &quot;Shoot &apos;em up&quot; films.\n\nPeoples&apos; script is definitely the movie&apos;s backbone, but it is Eastwood&apos;s masterful direction what transforms this meditation of violence into a unique revision of the Western. With a gritty and realistic approach very in tone with the script, Eastwood portraits the Wild West without romanticism and leaving out the mythic aspects of the genre, taking the revisionism of the Western one step beyond. Using Peoples&apos; script, Eastwood takes a critic view on the figure of the &quot;hero&quot; in Westerns, focusing on the image of the gunslinger and the use of violence to solve problems. Visually, Eastwood has crafted his most impressive movie since &quot;Bird&quot;, with an extensive use of shadows and light in the excellent work of cinematography by Jack N. Green. Eastwood&apos;s style, originated by the influence of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, and developed through many stages seems to finally have spawned its masterpiece in this film.\n\nAs William Munny, Clint Eastwood is simply perfect in what at first sight looks like an extension of his earlier &quot;Man with no name&quot; persona. William Munny has a name, and a past he wants to escape from, and Estwood captures the image of guilt and regret to the letter. This is easily one of his best roles to date. Morgan Freeman is also very good as Ned Logan, although like Jaimz Woolvett (who plays The Schofield Kid), gets easily overshadowed by Gene Hackman&apos;s powerful performance as Little Bill Daggett. Hackman completely owns every scene he is in, showcasing his enormous talent in a very dramatic role. The legendary Richard Harris has a small appearance as another aging gunslinger, English Bob, in very memorable scenes where he demonstrates why he is considered one of the best actors of his generation.\n\nAfter starting his career playing a mythical hero in Leone&apos;s &quot;Dollars&quot; trilogy, it is actually fitting that is Eastwood who explores the figure of hero in his many movies. Ever since his first directed western, Eastwood showed an interest in the duality of the hero, taking a special interest in the archetype of hero portrayed in the classic 1953 Western, &quot;Shane&quot;. Eastwood has explored this theme in many ways in the past: first as a true antihero (&quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;), then as a man becoming legend (&quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;) and later as a true mythic hero (&quot;Pale Rider&quot;); all this culminates in &quot;Unforgiven&quot; as the ultimate demythologization of the concept, and his final ode to the Western genre. While the movie indeed feels a bit &quot;preachy&quot; at times, the story is devised in such a way that it never feels too heavy handed, as it unfolds nicely as a classic epic tale of the West.\n\nPersonally, I can&apos;t praise this movie enough, as it is easily one of the best Westerns done since Peckinpah&apos;s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, and required viewing not only for fans of the genre. While some consider it an &quot;anti-Western&quot;, I think that with this movie, Eastwood&apos;s name can proudly stand along those of Ford, Hawks, Leone and Peckinpah as a master of the Western. &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is definitely Clint&apos;s masterpiece. 10/10",

That is why I could talk for days about this wonderful Oscar Submission!\n\nChildren Of Heaven is one of those rare films that not only I want to talk about, but everyone else who has seen it seems to be raving about. This tender and triumphant little jewel of a film had every head turning at the recent 1999 Nortel Palm Springs International Film Festival, January 7th-18th. After it&apos;s first showing at the festival, people were indeed talking!\n\n&quot;Did you see that film from Iran?&quot; &quot;No, any good?&quot; &quot;Just wait, go see it, we&apos;ll talk later!&quot;\n\nThe Children Of Heaven follows the relationship between an impoverished brother and sister, Ali and Zahra, who are thrust into a difficult circumstance all revolving around a pair of sneakers. How they choose to solve their problem themselves, without telling their parents, is what makes the story so heart-warming and unique. What follows is a tender, moving tale of compassion, determination, and deep family love.\n\nBravo writer/director Majid Majidi!"

And interestingly beautiful. I could watch most any of his movies, just to look at the beautiful scenery. I love some of the incredible imagination that goes into his works.\n\nI could easily recommend this film. No, it&apos;s not the better than the rest, but I feel it&apos;s definitely worth your time.\n\nI look forward to seeing the film again, maybe I will understand some things a bit better.",

The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone&apos;s &quot;Wall Street&quot;.\n\nWhere Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.\n\nLeonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.\n\nIt&apos;s a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.\n\nOne could almost hear Scorsese&apos;s clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.\n\nIt is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference. For every individual but also society as a whole."

            "reviewBody": "I once read a review of this film that criticized the fact that the American chief prosecutor as played by Richard Widmark was a less sympathetic and engaging character than the defending lawyer, Herr Rolfe as portrayed by Max Schell. Schell&apos;s Oscar winning performance illuminated the &quot;shattering truth&quot; that the film reveals about Nazism. Extremely able and educated men were able to rationalize what they did with an irresistible logic. They loved their country and, in a time of a national crisis, found it necessary to implement certain measures. As expounded by Rolfe, it all sounds so logical and reasonable. He also cites the fact that many world leaders actually commended Hitler upon his leadership in getting Germany out of the Depression as swiftly as he did.\n\nWidmark&apos;s character, Lawson, is understandably appalled by Herr Rolfe&apos;s defence of the indefencible and therefore he pulls no punches. He wants those responsible to be held fully responsible but he finds Germans who are ready to extenuate and rationalize. After he is told to tone down his demands for justice, Lawson acerbically retorts, &quot;There are no Nazis in Germany. It was those damned Eskimos.&quot; \n\nThe moment that illuminates how pure reason without humanity is so dangerous is when Pohl, a right hand man for Eichman, explains how it was possible to kill millions of people in purely technical terms. His explanation as he eats his lunch is devoid of any hint of human empathy for the victims he has so blithely exterminated. His was a job that was the logical extension of a policy and he carried it out with a detached and technical logic.\n\nThe key point that the film makes is that to be logical is not always to be morally right."

A modern artist with such clear and severe vision of the world. Boogie Nights, Magnolia, even Punch Drunk Love have an Wellesian disregard for what&apos;s in or out. His films are landmarks that may infuriate some, confuse others and mesmerize the rest of us. Here, with the rigorous tale of an impervious oil man, PT Anderson outdoes himself. He has Daniel Day Lewis as his accomplice in a performance that would be as difficult to match as it is difficult to describe. There is a monstrous beauty here that not even a broken nose can disguise. The saga is filled with long silent moments of tension that take place in a cinematic canvas and an actor&apos;s head. PT Anderson must have known that this was going to be, not only not a mainstream opus but a hard pill to swallow. I for one stand up to applaud his daringness."

            "reviewBody": "This is a great movie which much more historically accurate than it is often given credit for. So many who say otherwise are ill-informed and obviously don&apos;t know much about the actual history of that actual escape. The depiction of what happened to the recaptured prisoners in the movie of THE GREAT ESCAPE is reasonably accurate as detailed on the historyinfilm site...specifically on the &quot;Reprisal&quot; page; along with being detailed in the various published accounts.\n\nHitler ultimately calmed down after being reasoned with by Goering, Feldmarschall Keitel, Maj-Gen Graevenitz and Maj-Gen Westhoff, and dictated that more than half the prisoners be shot and cremated. So, as depicted in the film, several of those recaptured were not executed and were indeed returned to confinement. In fact, even those executed were not &quot;shot on the spot&quot; for the most part, but were actually executed later after being turned over to the Gestapo; most being shot while being allowed to relieve themselves, under the guise of &quot;trying to escape&quot;.\n\nFurthermore, there are many accounts as to how much more humane the environment was within the camp (which even had a popular and very successful theatre, featuring prisoners who would later be name performers) than many other POW camps...and certainly nothing like the harsh conditions associated with the Concentration or Extermination camps.\n\nTo quote one source:\n\n&quot;It must be made clear that the German Luftwaffe [the German Air Force], who were responsible for Air Force prisoners of war, maintained a degree of professional respect for fellow flyers, and the general attitude of the camp security officers and guards should not be confused with the SS or Gestapo. The Luftwaffe treated the POWs well, despite an erratic and inconsistent supply of food.\n\nPrisoners were handled quite fairly within the Geneva Convention, and the Kommandant, Oberst (Colonel) Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau, was a professional and honourable soldier who won the respect of the senior prisoners.&quot;\n\nFinally, virtually all the major engineering aspects in regards to the tunnels and the initial escape in the film are as they were actually acheived in the real escape.\n\nIt would behoove some to learn a little more actual history or do a little simple research before shooting from the hip with supposed &quot;knowledge&quot; of reality. THE GREAT ESCAPE certainly takes liberties in tone and character portrayal, but not in the key elements that are disparaged out of sneering ignorance.\n\nBRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also a great film, but took even greater liberties with the technical details of the events described than THE GREAT ESCAPE did....and offering up VON RYAN&apos;S EXPRESS as a more realistic alternative is simply delusional and ridiculous."

            "reviewBody": "As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I&apos;m well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a &quot;moneymaker&quot; for them because he&apos;s the nation&apos;s best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.\n\nRothstein&apos;s partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.\n\nIf you are a gambler or know the &quot;wiseguy&quot; culture, the movie doesn&apos;t have to be explained, while if you aren&apos;t, you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;ve stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.\n\nMost of us wouldn&apos;t like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we&apos;ll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film&apos;s nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the &quot;old school&quot; types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).",

            "reviewBody": "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I&apos;d be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.\n\nA special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose &apos;Captain Vidal&apos; is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu&apos;s quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I&apos;ve seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting &apos;Pale Man&apos; - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.\n\nBut the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete&apos;s hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one&apos;s death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.\n\nI loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don&apos;t give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro&apos;s greatest work to date.",

The film illustrates to the viewer how deeply a handicap can infiltrate the domestic, professional, and personal lives of those unfortunate to have these types of issues.

            "reviewBody": "When Juan Jose Campanella is not directing episodes of Law and Order, CSI or the like, he periodically returns to Argentina make a movie. In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection.",

            "reviewBody": "The story of boxer Jake La Motta from his rising star in the 1940&apos;s through to his own downfall and his eventual living on the cabaret circuit in the present day.\n\nScorsese and De Niro \u0096 nobody needs say any more.  Whether it be media satire (King of Comedy), small time thugs (Mean Streets) or real gangsta s**t (Goodfellas), the two rarely miss.  This was one of their best to date (and probably for ever).  The story is fascinating in itself but as an examination of masculinity it excels.  The film allows us to watch a man who goes along with all the things he thinks make him a man \u0096 even when those characteristics and habits begin to destroy everything he has \u0096 his marriage, his realtionships and his career.  Combine this with the gripping boxing tale of ups and downs and you have a film that never outstays it&apos;s welcome.\n\nScorsese is on top form \u0096 the use of black and white any have been a quality issue, but he uses it well.  The fight scenes are other worldly \u0096 exaggerated to the extent that it is breathtaking and more shocking than previous boxing scenes in other movies. My favourite effect is the sound editing in the fights where silence and calm seem to descend just before key moments\u0085..amazing.  The relationship stuff is also gripping and Scorsese handles he human cost just as well as he shows us the physical beatings.\n\nDe Niro is amazing \u0096 the method stuff alone is great, but his whole performance is intense.  Similarly Moriaty, Pesci and Frank Vincent are excellent \u0096 however they all stand in De Niro&apos;s shadow.\n\nOverall \u0096 an excellent film on so many levels, as a story, as a examination of masculinity, as a sports film, as a lesson in direction and editing\u0085..this excels in so many ways \u0096 may it never drop out of the top ten from the twentieth century!"

            "reviewBody": "I knew CHINATOWN was hailed as the paragon of a film noir, and that&apos;s why I finally got down to watching it. However, despite having known about the movie for quite a while, I wasn&apos;t really prepared for just how dark it could be. The movie starts slowly, with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. But soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy, murder, lies and deceit. The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.\n\nIn a recent New York Times piece, they called CHINATOWN &quot;a meditation on evil&quot;, which is spot-on. Set in 1937, this movie is just all-round perfect, first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie, that is rich in themes (water, evil, trust, guilt, greed) and even richer in suspense, as the audience\u2014just like our protagonist\u2014tries to find out what is happening. The story is &quot;complex&quot; for sure, but it&apos;s not &quot;complicated&quot;. Everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.\n\nBesides the impeccable screenplay, everything else about this movie is perfect as well. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. Dunaway&apos;s stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. The set pieces are beautiful, the score is compelling; and camera-work and editing could not be any better. There is a reason this one is called a classic! So, if you&apos;re ready to delve deep into a richly layered exploration of the dark side of humanity\u2014enjoy the ride. But don&apos;t expect to come back unscathed.",

There are so many wonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I&apos;m convinced that Ang Lee thought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can&apos;t see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any age as well. Enjoy.",

The film doesn&apos;t go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won&apos;t get needlessly scared.\n\nThe film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film.

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not sure whether to call this a black comedy or a comedy-noir. The story is about four working class lads who have each managed to save up 25,000 pounds to spot their card-shark friend for a high-stakes poker game with &quot;Hatchet&quot; Harry, the local gangster.\n\nUnfortunately, Harry&apos;s game is rigged and the four end up owing Harry half a million pounds, with just one week to come up with the cash. What ensues is a set of schemes, counter-schemes, rip-offs, and bad/good luck that demand you pay attention. On several occasions I had to pause the video just to take stock of which gang was planning what.\n\nThe final thirty minutes of the film, as the plots all collide and overlap, turn set-piece shoot outs into comedic punchlines.  The comedy is driven by exploding our expectations of what are otherwise pretty standard scenes from the film-noir genre.\n\nThe acting is strong and the script very tight. Although I am not normally a fan of voice overs, this one informs without spoiling the action. And I liked the use of the slow-motion to disrupt the action and keep me paying attention.\n\nWhile this film may not be for everyone, if you enjoy a darker pallette, this may be right up your alley."

            "reviewBody": "After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford&apos;s 1953 tale of romance and adventure, &quot;Mogambo&quot;, the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However, what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction, Kelly made an integral part of the Master&apos;s films, becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock&apos;s idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western &quot;High Noon&quot;, one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; was the first of Hitchcock&apos;s films with Kelly, and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme: the perfect murder.\n\nThe movie is the story of Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), a former tennis player married to the beautiful and wealthy Margot (Grace Kelly) and living in an nice apartment in London. Life is good for Tony, until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with an old flame of her, famous crime novel writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). After that discovery, Tony spends a whole years plotting the perfect way to murder his wife in order to inherit her money, carefully planning every detail of the crime. When Mark visits London again, Tony finds the perfect chance to set his plan in motion, and as planned, he recruits Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) to kill his wife. However, bad luck and a sudden change of events will test Tony&apos;s plan&apos;s infallibility as, just as Mark points out, human action can originate flaws even in the most perfectly devised plan.\n\nLike most Hitchcock&apos;s films, &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; was an adaptation of another art-form, this time a popular play by Frederick Knott. As Knott was also the writer of the screenplay, the movie remains extremely faithful to the play, although of course, not without its differences. Knott&apos;s script is wonderfully constructed, as like in the play, the dialog is witty and simply captivating, with many twists and turns that spiced up the complex plot and keep it from being boring or tiresome. An interesting feature of the movie is that oddly, there are no black and white morality in the characters, and it&apos;s easy not only to sympathize with Margot (despite she being cheating on her husband) but also to sympathize with Tony (despite he wanting to kill his wife), as the characters are wonderfully developed with very detailed personalities.\n\nIt seems that Hitchcock&apos;s knows that the dialog is the highlight of the play, as he deliberately focuses on his actors and uses an elegant camera-work to frame the whole movie inside the apartment. The movie literally is shot entirely in one single room (only two other sets are used, and only briefly), but Hitchcock&apos;s classy way of using the camera allow a highly dynamic flow that never lets the movie be tiresome. This is also very helpful as Hitchcock just lets his characters keep speaking, carefully describing actions and events (when other directors would use flashbacks) in a similar way to a what the real play would be. While this approach could easily get boring, Hitchcock&apos;s use of colors and overall visual imagery simply creates the perfect medium to allow Knott&apos;s dialog to shine.\n\nWithout disrespecting John Ford or Fred Zinnemann, I think that it was Hitchcock who finally could allow Kelly&apos;s talent to shine beyond her physical beauty. Grace Kelly makes her character shine with her subtle and restrained performance, specially showing her skill in the second half of the film. While often Kelly receives top honors in this movie, it is actually Ray Milland who makes the whole movie work with his suave and charming &quot;villian&quot;. Milland&apos;s performance is simply terrific, making his character nice enough to win the sympathies of the audience, yet still frighteningly intelligent as the mastermind of the plot. John Williams appears as the Inspector in charge to solve the complex puzzle, and delivers a classic performance as the Enlgish gentleman decided to find the final answer. Only Robert Cummings seems miscast as Mark Halliday, although a lot of his weak performance could be blamed to Milland, Kelly and Williams overshadowing him with their excellent work.\n\nIn many ways, &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; shares many things with &quot;Rope&quot;, as not only the two films are based on successful plays, they are also about committing the perfect murder and oddly, they are both &quot;experiments&quot;: while &quot;Rope&quot; was conceived as a &quot;movie in one take&quot;, &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; was done as 3-D movie. Sadly, the interest in 3-D was dying when the film was released, so few theaters carried the movie complete with the gimmick; a real shame, as Hitchcock&apos;s use of the technology, unlike most 3-D films of its time, was conceived as a way to enhance the claustrophobia of the Wendices&apos; apartment instead of using it to merely shock the audience with &quot;stuff coming out of the screen&quot; (as seen in for example, &quot;House of Wax&quot;). While not too fond of the gimmick, Hitchcock truly gave it a good and intelligent (albeit subtle) use to it.\n\n&quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; is probably less celebrated than the Master&apos;s most famous movies, the fact that it came out the same years as &quot;Rear Window&quot; (again with Grace Kelly) may have had something to do with it too. While a subtler and more restrained tale of suspense, this is still the Master at his best, as the movie proves that when he was at the top of his game, no other director was comparable to him. 9/10",

He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich. What he does not realize is that he may find love (in the form of Georgia Hale) instead of money. In the end that may be all right with him. &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer, writer and director he was. Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the 20th Century, Chaplin showed humanity, love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career. The movie is exceptional in every way. Although I am not as well-versed with movies from the 1920s as I am with the decades following it, I would still probably call &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; the finest film of that 10-year period. Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today. 5 stars out of 5."

            "reviewBody": "Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That&apos;s the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nFrom the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don&apos;t know &apos;cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.\n\nThe acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who&apos;s just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.\n\nYou may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven&apos;t seen it all until you&apos;ve seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.\n\nThe movie didn&apos;t get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it&apos;s not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I&apos;ve asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.\n\nThe movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I&apos;ve seen it several times, but it&apos;s just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don&apos;t like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!",

            "reviewBody": "The mysteries of religion and death have long been a popular focus among artists of all media, including film.  And while many films question these mysteries, they seldom provide any real insight into the world of the unknown.  In Ingmar Bergman&apos;s THE SEVENTH SEAL, these mysteries are not only questioned; they are dissected, splayed, and scrutinized.\n\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL could very well serve as sort of a manifesto for existentialism.  Its deep acuity and haunting imagery is powerful enough to jar even passive viewers out of their complacency and force them to examine their own reality.  The delicately crafted story centers around a 14th century knight named Antonius Block and his ongoing game of chess with a shadowy, hooded figure: Death.  Bergman uses this allegory not just to personify death, but to illustrate the lengths man will go to in order to avoid it.  In the end, however, Death is a much better player than any of us, and though he may humor some of his opponents by letting them think that they have the advantage, the end result is inevitable: Death always wins. No matter how skillfully we plan our moves or how determined we are to win, we can never beat Death.\n\nIn Antonius&apos;s search for answers, he encounters a variety of very unique characters, each with their own outlook on life, death, faith, fear and love.  Their commentary on such matters is often dryly funny and always brilliant, continuously and effectively challenging our perceptions of the world around us.  For me, the dialogue was definitely the high point of the film, as it was extremely thought-provoking and carefully constructed throughout.  Almost every line spoken is, in one way or another, daunting and unforgettable.  J\u00f6ns&apos;s description of love as &quot;the blackest of all plagues&quot; is a quote that will forever be engraved in my mind.\n\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL truly is a remarkable accomplishment in the world of cinema.  It is a deep, mesmerizing, and darkly beautiful work of art.  More importantly, THE SEVENTH SEAL is one of those rare movies that doesn&apos;t just entertain, but also has the power to change the way one thinks."

A  timeless work that can never be surpassed.",

            "reviewBody": "Nobody but Lynch could have directed this movie and made it the masterpiece that it is. Where other people would have gone for fake sentimentality and/or gruesome imagery; Lynch just presents the story how it is. The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it&apos;s credit. It is, however, utterly repulsive. The black and white cinematography enforces this. There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it&apos;s title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be. On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it&apos;s title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking. The movie sets itself up for this early on; the scene in which the Elephant Man is introduced is most of the most gut wrenching ever committed to film. As the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) sees the freak rise up and realises the extent of his deformity...a tear slowly form and rolls down his cheek. From this, you can see the pity that he feels for this man who has drawn the lot of a lowly circus freak; just from that one shot of a tear, David Lynch shows us the sorrow and the pity, and that&apos;s all he needs. Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that&apos;s all it needs, so that&apos;s all it gets. And that is the mark of a great director. Something that David Lynch most certainly is.\n\nThe film is also ironic. Aside from it&apos;s visuals that link to the title character, it also observes how society is not unlike a circus. The good doctor has taken the Elephant Man away from the glares and the scowls of the circus audience, the exploitation that he&apos;s had to face, and put him a kinder and more loving environment; only now the scowls and stares come not from the circus audience, but from society&apos;s upper crust, who want to exploit the Elephant Man themselves for their own selfish reasons - to impress their friends. The Elephant Man is not merely a horror story of the life of a very unfortunate man; it&apos;s a story of love, a story of acceptance. Despite being taken from one circus to another, the Elephant Man is happier and more fulfilled than he ever was; he doesn&apos;t care about the looks and the exploitation, he merely wants to be loved. By &apos;normal&apos; people, this is taken for granted; but The Elephant Man shows us that love and acceptance isn&apos;t something that can be taken for granted. As one doctor notes in the film, &quot;we can&apos;t imagine the life he&apos;s had&quot;. We can&apos;t.\n\nDavid Lynch also succeeds in making voyeurs out of his audience. Just like the various audiences in the film; we too want to see the Elephant Man, and yet are utterly repulsed and disgusted by him. With this, David Lynch makes a mockery out of today&apos;s society, without ever making a mockery out of the character upon which this film is based. The Elephant Man himself is a perfectly balanced example of how pathos can be achieved. Not only is this man seen as a monster, but his character is pathetic also. With The Elephant Man, Lynch is saying to the world that it is society that is the monster, not the freaks that live within it.\n\nTo put it simply: David Lynch has taken a story that could have easily been told simply and expanded it to take in themes that are outside of the central premise. This small story of one unfortunate man has been moulded into a striking comment on society. And all in all; it&apos;s a masterpiece.",

Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.\n\nIt is such a relief that the performances of Willis and the excellent Osment live up to an excellently directed quality storyline. I will be disappointed if the youngster doesn&apos;t receive at least an academy nomination.\n\nI seldom go to the cinema twice to watch a film, in fact I cannot remember when I have done it before. Tonight I am taking an old friend to see this film as it will be a tragedy if he doesn&apos;t see it on the big screen. He has heard so much about it that he is reluctant to go, as I am when something is over-hyped. Just for a change though, here is a film that lives up to its billing and has you thinking about it for weeks to come. As for the twist at the end? Well it totally disorientated me, my mind spinning back throughout the whole film. A fantastic punchline to my film of the year.",

This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from &apos;The Truman Show&apos; feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he&apos;s a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don&apos;t know whether he&apos;s helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.\n\nWeir, who directed the great &apos;Witness&apos;, uses different camera angles to make you feel like you&apos;re actually watching &apos;The Truman Show&apos; and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances. Andrew Niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of it&apos;s inventiveness and ingenuity. Overall, &apos;The Truman Show&apos; is what I like to call a true American classic.",

If you haven&apos;t seen this movie yet, get out from your cave and see it right away. I have seen this movie umpteen times and it still shocks and suprises me. If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this. Spielberg is a true genius. Almost all of his movies were great. 10/10!"

Bergman&apos;s autobiographical story also benefits from the brilliant casting of Swedish film legend Victor Sjostrom as Isak Borg, whose towering performance is essential to the success of Wild Strawberries.  I read that Bergman based the coffin dream sequence on a frequent nightmare that he had -- and it never ceases to amaze me just how effective it remains even after all these years.  Wild Strawberries seems like a quiet, thoughtful, introsepective movie -- and it is; it is also one of world cinema&apos;s most impressive motion pictures."

In the funeral meets a gorgeous scene actress (haunting Alida Valli). Manipulative Harry is a known delinquent and drug-dealer, smuggling adulterated penicilin in black-market as well as a master-criminal at large in a Vienna of nightmare divided in four zones, the city is plenty of ruins, trash, devastation , rubbish and debris. Lime is allegedly dead , but is finally pursued throughout the sewers by military authorities (Trevor Howard, Bernard Lee, Geoffrey Keen).\n\nBased on Grahame Greene novel, this classic noir thriller is an excellent story lavishly produced by the great American producer David O&apos;Selznick and Hungarian producer Alexander Korda. This is a deeply satisfying and intelligent picture to not be missed, using a considerable talent in acting, as main cast as secondary actors formed mostly by foreigner players of various countries and utilizing the cream of the cream of British experts in writing and technical departments. With a plethora of anthological images and dialogs, such as the scenes about conversation in the marry-go-round between Harry Lime and Martin, and the underground-sewers pursuits. Magnificent Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten, great friends in real life ; Welles reportedly intervened in direction mainly on his scenes, though at an interview he explained that Carol Reed directed totally this outstanding movie. Extraordinary Anton Karas&apos; musical score , though insistent and sometimes irritant zither which hooked itself into the people all around the world. Robert Krasker&apos;s gorgeous cinematography , reflecting splendidly the shapes , lights, shadows in sophisticated, elegant use of camera angles and deservedly winning an Oscar and nomination for film-making and edition. The film was perfectly directed by Carol Reed in the second adaptation about Grahame Greene novel, the first was &apos;The fallen idol (1948)&apos; and later &apos;Our man in Havana (1959)&apos;.",

Things quickly mushroom with the discovery of more bodies, more suspects and no end in sight.\n\nWhether you like police films or not you should see this movie about the real hunt for Korea&apos;s first known serial killer simply because its a great movie. This is a movie that alters your expectations and changes your view of things. Its impossible to guess whats going to happen simply because the twists and turns are so unexpected. At times this is a funny funny movie, especially if you like shows like Law and Order or CSI since what we take for granted in those shows is stood on its head. At other times this is a very taut thriller and you become as desperate as the police in needing to put an end to the madness.\n\nOn top of all of this is a picture of Korea in 1986, a place with political unrest and civil defense drills that for me at least makes it seem like something out of the 1950&apos;s.\n\nThis is brilliant brilliant film-making.\n\nI&apos;ve given the film an 8 out of 10, even though it probably deserves to be higher, simply because some 12 hours after seeing the film, I&apos;m still pondering what I thought of it, how good is it? At least an 8. I&apos;m sure a second and third and fourth viewings will change my mind.\n\nYea its that good",

Blade Runner is not such a film. But I am grateful for this, for after maturing a bit and rewatching the movie a couple of times, I discovered its greatness. It is not a traditional sci-fi movie, it&apos;s a touching drama about the value of life and the importance of making the most of what you&apos;ve got. One of the most important themes in the film is the question of what is more valuable - humans without emotions, or machines with? The film gives no answer - it just opens our eyes and makes us aware that we should be grateful for being alive.\n\nSome people prefer the Director&apos;s Cut, but I like the original version better - mostly because of the wonderful end line: &quot;I didn&apos;t know how long we had together. Who does?&quot; That pretty much sums it up."

            "reviewBody": "In the aftermath of _Pulp Fiction_, much of the filmmaking of the 1990s thrived upon attempts to appear &quot;edgy&quot; within the constructs of independent films, or merely to provide empty shock value cliches. And no film ever came close to the sheer cleverness of Tarantino&apos;s masterpiece.\n\n_Trainspotting_, however, somehow manages to take the excesses of the mid-90s and rise far, far above the cinematic cliches that it easily could have become. A film that tackles any hot-button social issue can, and usually does, simply become a didactic propaganda piece. Thankfully, _Trainspotting_ is vastly more intelligent in its edginess and its shock.\n\nIn order to appreciate _Trainspotting_ fully, the viewer must abandon any preconceptions about what defines truly great cinema, because this film defies convention at nearly every turn. And with the rapid pace of its plot, that&apos;s quite a bit of ground to cover.\n\nThough a great deal of the picture&apos;s brilliance is derived from director Danny Boyle&apos;s consistent rejection of typical cinematic techniques, the most satisfying and _best_ aspect of _Trainspotting_ is that Boyle creates a film that is neither pro-drug or anti-drug. Instead, he maintains a rare objectivity throughout the film, depicting this fascinating array of complex, beautifully acted characters with an honesty that it seldom captured on film. And, given the life that each character lives, it&apos;s nearly incomprehensible that a director would refrain from influencing the viewer&apos;s impressions in any way, yet that&apos;s exactly what Boyle does.\n\nThe dialogue-- or at least what portions of the brogue-drenched dialogue American viewers will be able to comprehend-- is alternately hilarious, raw, and brutal. And Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle bring a remarkable compassion and depth to their portrayals of characters that could have easily lapsed into cliche.\n\nDespite its sheer brilliance, _Trainspotting_ is not a film that&apos;s easy to watch. The viewer is bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort in their horror-- this movie contains two of the most graphic, horrifying scenes I&apos;ve ever encountered. But, amazingly, none of these elements is used merely for shock value. Though the viewer will be mortified by some of the things that happen onscreen-- the well-documented dive into Scotland&apos;s most vile public toilet, for example-- these scenes all make _perfect sense_ within the context of a masterfully told story.\n\nIn order to notice all of the subtlety that also exists in _Trainspotting_, repeat viewings are necessary, primarily to reduce some of the most powerful shocks ever-so-slightly, though their effects are never lost entirely. Some of the images will likely haunt even the most cynical, jaded viewer for weeks.\n\nRATING: 10 out of 10. Never patronizing and completely unpretentious, _Trainspotting_ is one of the most daring, unconventional films ever made. It inspires a level of discomfort rivaled by very few movies, because, even at its most graphic, Boyle never insults the viewer with mere shock tactics. Brilliantly acted, directed, and written, with a truly rare objectivity that allows each viewer to interpret its story on his/her own terms.",

            "reviewBody": "The Coen brothers&apos; &apos;Fargo&apos; is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn&apos;t even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn&apos;t. Above all else, perhaps, &apos;Fargo&apos; lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there&apos;s a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it&apos;s own; but it won&apos;t make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn&apos;t called a masterpiece I might almost like it.",

            "reviewBody": "About as Oscar-worthy as any film made in the &apos;50s is David Lean&apos;s gripping BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Based loosely on a real-life incident, it tells the story of an imprisoned British officer (Alec Guinness) who loses sight of his mission when forced to build a bridge for the Japanese that will enable the enemy to carry supplies by train through the jungle during World War II. Guinness plays the crisp British officer to perfection, brilliant in all of his scenes but especially in his confrontations with Sessue Hayakawa. William Holden has a pivotal role as one of the prisoners who escapes and enjoys his freedom for awhile before being asked to return with a small squadron to destroy the bridge. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne have colorful roles too and all are superb under David Lean&apos;s direction.\n\nThe jungle settings filmed in Ceylon add the necessary realism to the project and there is never a suspension of interest although the story runs well over two-and-a-half hours. The film builds to a tense and magnificent climax with an ending that seems to be deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking. Well worth watching, especially if shown in the restored letterbox version now being shown on TCM.\n\nSome of the best lines go to William Holden and he makes the most of a complex role--a mixture of cynicism and heroism in a character that ranks with his best anti-hero roles in films of the &apos;50s. He brings as much conviction to his role as Alec Guinness does and deserved a Best Actor nomination that he did not get."

It&apos;s definitely not a young children&apos;s film, as there&apos;s precious little to entertain them, but it does have much to consider for older children and (young) adults. As a rumination on what drives us all through life, this is very effective, but I do feel that the story lacks something for making Riley so isolated in her world. Perhaps if she interacted a bit more in the story, this would be a more involving film, but the reflections on lost innocence do add some poignancy and lift this film slightly above average."

            "name": "Pixar Remains the Best Family Film Industry Out There Today...",
            "reviewBody": "Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn&apos;t say kid films). &quot;Toy Story&quot; 1 &amp; 2 and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; are some of my favorite family films; &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; isn&apos;t one of my favorites, but it isn&apos;t disappointing like &quot;A Bug&apos;s Life,&quot; and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.\n\nAs always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In &quot;Toy Story&quot; they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; they showed us the monster world. In my review on &quot;A Bug&apos;s Life,&quot; I said that the reason the film didn&apos;t work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.\n\nThis tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.\n\nYears later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot&apos;s son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)\n\nPixar doesn&apos;t let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.\n\n&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist&apos;s office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe&apos;s vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist&apos;s tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie &quot;Platoon&quot; might have something to do with that.\n\nThis is taken from my &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; review: &quot;Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my &apos;Toy Story&apos; review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience&apos;s INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of &apos;Toy Story&apos; and &apos;Monsters, Inc.,&apos; but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for &apos;Toy Story 3&apos;) and gives them the bare minimum.\n\nWith &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they separate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it&apos;s almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself.",

And yes, it may be, to some, &quot;just another fight movie. However, Warrior has the audacity to challenge the clich\u00e9&apos;s and still manages to stand out from the rest. Bottom line, Warrior is a well written and directed emotional roller coaster that will have you at the edge of your seat. With a star studded cast and top notch acting, the performances were solid and believable. Nick Nolte in particular did a fantastic job with his role and will have you nearly in tears. As the movie progresses you will be torn on what you would like to see happen for the climax of this entertaining thrill ride. Movies with this much emotional power connected to the characters only come around every once in a while. Go see this movie to finish off the summer or forever regret not supporting what is sure to be a classic!"

It&apos;s a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It&apos;s a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It&apos;s the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn&apos;t be introduced in the movie without extending the film&apos;s length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands.",

            "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t take my mind off this movie. The story is both universally human (old age, the end of life, parents and children) and specifically Japanese. The movie tells the viewer so much about Japanese middle class life in the 1950s: eating and sleeping; mourning the war dead; clothes and home furnishings; spoiled kids; a doctor&apos;s office; a schoolroom; life in Tokyo and small towns; how family members talk to each other; old men&apos;s drinking habits; a resort hotel. But while we see all these details of a real time and place, we are constantly drawn into reflection on the meaning of human life and relationships. The reflection emerges effortlessly from the simple narrative and the specifics. The director never annoyingly tells us how to feel, he is not preaching and not drawing attention to himself. (There is none of that &quot;hey, I&apos;m making a moving movie&quot; crud that you get in Hollywood treatment of these topics). He just lets the story unfold in a quiet, natural way. It&apos;s not for folks who only like &quot;action&quot; movies. I put &quot;action&quot; in quotes because this movie is about the real action in life--enjoying life, sharing it with others, facing the end of it.",

Cobb), the arrogant mob boss\u0085 \n\nFriendly takes affectionate interest in Terry and tries to make things easy for him\u0085 He also takes advantage of Terry by involving him in the killing of an uncooperative docker\u0085 Unaware of their murderous intentions, Terry sets the trap for the man who is thrown from a roof top because he allowed himself to be interviewed by a crime investigating commission\u0085\n\nTerry&apos;s alienation from the crooked union leaders starts when he meets the dead man&apos;s sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint), and realizes the grief he has brought into her life\u0085 She asks his help in bringing the racketeers to justice, as does Father Barry (Karl Malden), a priest of complete goodness and rightness\u0085 \n\nBrando&apos;s moral dilemma was superbly drawn in the film\u0085 He&apos;s an ordinary man finding the courage to stand up and be counted\u0085 As portrayed by Brando he is touchingly believable\u0085 \n\nThe rest of the cast is excellent:\n\nCobb is extremely good as the brute fury boss who intimidates the workers into silence, stopping at nothing to maintain his position of power on the docks... \n\nRod Steiger gives his finest performance as the clever and suave opportunistic lawyer who works for the local docker&apos;s union...\n\nEva Marie Saint manages to make the blood go through Brando&apos;s valves reviving and creating a heart that never existed before... \n\nKarl Malden is hard and clear as the activist Catholic priest who continue encouraging other longshoremen to testify, inciting Brando to fight for his rights\u0097regardless of the cost\u0097rather than be a pawn in a ruthless system of bribes and killings... \n\n&quot;On the Waterfront&quot; is one of the great American films, not only because it bravely spreads a strong light on the violation of justice, but because it is a powerful piece of cinema, which push forward a classic study of man&apos;s responsibility to his fellow man... \n\nThe film won eight Academy Awards...",

            "reviewBody": "This movie came out in Turkey late 2005, without much advertising. It&apos;s a small family drama, set largely in western rural turkey in 1987. Within a couple of weeks, the film became a smash hit solely through word-of-mouth. Since then, it has received every national award and has become the third-biggest grossing film of the country&apos;s history by mid-March (it could go even higher, considering it&apos;s still playing in theaters after several months). It is indeed a good movie, but i doubt it&apos;ll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It&apos;s well-written, well-acted and well-shot; but some of the jokes, and especially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm will be lost on international audiences i&apos;m afraid. Similarly, the film doesn&apos;t give much information about the political events that unfold in the background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is that it reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films, from the industry&apos;s heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerker melodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted, the melodrama bits are rather manipulative, but effective nonetheless. I heard that a tissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to the ingoing audiences, don&apos;t know if it&apos;s true though. My one (small) problem with the film is a few anachronistic details, but i guess they wouldn&apos;t even be noticed by someone who wasn&apos;t around then and there. If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way (not very likely, but anyway), give it a shot. It&apos;s worth watching just to see the little kid in the leading role."

What do they have in common? All of them are a mix between drama and comedy. The script is hilarious, even if the lines are sad, it&apos;s so full of black comedy, that there were people rolling on the floor laughing at the Cinema. \n\nI&apos;d write much more about this film, but i think i might be spoiling it, so i prefer to tell you that i can&apos;t wait to watch it again. So please do NOT miss it.",

Throughout the entire running time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.\n\nThe director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano&apos;s). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking cinematography.\n\nAll those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits roll.",

            "reviewBody": "It seems to me that I see Tarkovsky&apos; movies differently from many other people. For me this film is not &quot;too long&quot; or boring. For me this is one of the best movies ever made.\n\nWestern culture has a very long tradition of film-making. Usually typical western movie is focused on &quot;story&quot;. (Of course - not always) The sharpness and tension of the movie are achieved by the big number of cuts or by the fast varying of shots or by the sudden varying of plans or by some surprising angle of camera etc. Tarkovsky don&apos;t like cuts. The number of cuts is minimal. His camera is moving like in dream (Bergman envied Tarkovsky for that), it has no angles at all. Colours are pale, &quot;dirty&quot;, very tender, soft, almost black-and-white.\n\nIn a typical western movie dialog is followed by the camera. Picture is illustrating text and is subordinated to it. In Stalker text and visual image are coexisting, cooperating with each-other. Both are moving on their own ways but at the same time, somehow - harmonically. Text and picture are not subordinated, they are both independent.\n\nWhy is Tarkovsky using such a weird language? Surely not only because he wants to opposite the dogmas of western cinema. He has a positive message too. Audience of his films has to understand his films not only at the level of thinking or emotions, but at the level of much deeper consciousness. Therefore watching his movies means rather meditation than watching-TV-and-eating-popcorn. The purpose of Tarkovsky&apos;s films is to loose the mind of audiences, to wake it up to much deeper attention. So that audiences can simply watch and see.\n\nStalker is not an entertainment and is not supposed to be. It means there is no sense at all to watch Stalker, when you need some amusing entertainment. Stalker is a serious movie. It is very narrow-minded to evaluate movies on the assumption of entertainment only. Of course, we live in the world of movie-consumers, produced by powerful film-companies, demanding more and more and more exciting entertainment. Consumer doesn&apos;t understand this movie. For him it is big bore.",

            "reviewBody": "Wes Anderson is one of the most original film makers working today. None of his films can be categorized into any particular genre. His latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin Film Festival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale within another tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let his imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the author of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the young author &amp; F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand Budapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the tale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set in the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train ride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson &amp; countless cameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for Art house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. The production design and music are outstanding and even the end credits are imaginatively done (and received another ovation from the audience)."

            "reviewBody": "Three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania prepare to go to war in Vietnam.  The night before they go, Steven is married, sparking a large celebration.  The next morning they go deer hunting one last time in the woods before they leave.  Time passes and the three meet up again in Vietnam as prisoners of war. Brutal mental torture affects them in different ways before they escape and are separated again.  Back in Pennsylvania Michael realises the extent to which the war has not only affected him but devastated the lives of his friends in different ways.\n\nI have seen this film several times and I&apos;ll admit that I always assume that it is a classic film mainly because I saw it twice when I was in my early teens and was blown away by parts of it.  I say this because I want to acknowledge that it may not be as great a film as many critics lists believe it to be, but at the same time I still watch it occasionally as I find it to be a moving story and a good film.  The plot is moving if it is viewed on it&apos;s surface as a tale of three men whose lives are deeply affected by the war.  Going past that to deeper themes I always feel that the film doesn&apos;t manage to be as deep as it thinks it is, so I try not to linger too long on these.\n\nThe breakdown of the film gives significantly more time to events in the home town rather than Vietnam.  This is as it should be \u0096 for many people the war was a fleeting thing that has stayed with them for much longer than they were actually involved.  The wedding scene is a little overlong but it does serve as a chance to get to see the characters in their setting before we quickly move to the events that changed them and the people they become. The time in Vietnam is quite short but very memorable (many people who have never seen the film will still know these scenes) and the final hour or so of the film is moving even if it takes things to an extreme to make it&apos;s point.\n\nThe cast make the film work as well, if not more, than the material itself. De Niro is the rock on which it all stands and is pretty good.  The only weakness in his performance was that he was the one who had to be `the hero&apos; type who does what he can.  Walken gets the lion share of praise for his is the role that changes the most significantly throughout the film.  It is easy to forget that he was not anywhere near as famous as De Niro at this time and it is amazing in that regard to see him hold his own.  Savage gives a good performance and support is strong in the form of such actors as Cazale, Dzundza and Aspegren.  Even Streep gives a performance refreshingly free of sentiment or forced accents.\n\nThe film is a little overlong and could easily have lost 30 minutes (although not all from one place) to give it a tighter feel.  Some scenes feel stretched beyond their useful duration leading to the feel that the film wanted to be 3 hours long, rather than being cut back to 3 hours long. Despite this though I still think this is a good film that is a powerful story at it&apos;s heart. I personally don&apos;t think it would make my top 50 (were I ever to do one) but I will watch it again."

            "reviewBody": "This film flopped when it was released in late 1926 for several reasons. First, its premiere was delayed because &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot; was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks. Second, people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian, not Buster the filmmaker and director, which is more of the role he played here. The film was funny, but it was not gag after gag, like so many of Keaton&apos;s other films. Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South. A title card declares he has two loves - his girl and his engine. when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist, but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession. His girlfriend misunderstands, thinks him a coward, and says she won&apos;t speak to him again until he is in uniform.\n\nMeanwhile, the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Buster&apos;s train. Unknown to Buster, his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft. Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train, still without the knowledge of his girl&apos;s captivity by the Union army.\n\nForgotten with the arrival of sound, the film revived - often cut up from its original length - in the 1950&apos;s because Buster didn&apos;t preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain. That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today, often with poor video and hideous musical accompaniment.\n\nToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films, and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too. SHERLOCK, JR. is clever. OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious. The General is both of these things. It&apos;s story driven, races to a climax, and is fueled by cute, clever, inventive gags.Buster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in &quot;A Southern Yankee&quot;.",

Instead of being preachy or having an all to obvious agenda, he lets his viewers make up their own minds. His characters don&apos;t have a message, they have a life and make no excuses for who they are. In so many subtle and intelligent ways we are allowed to make our own choices. Like with Kowalski in the movie, you are not confronted with a role model hammering home all those &quot;life&apos;s important messages&quot;, but rather with a movie saying &quot;Look! This is the way it worked out for me. And I think I know a few tricks that might help you, but in the end it&apos;s your own life. However, you have to trust me when I say that there are a some things you don&apos;t want to see or experience!&quot;. Some people will leave this movie entirely untouched, others will certainly be crying their guts out. Not because some people &quot;get it&quot; and others &quot;don&apos;t&quot;, but because it is a brilliant piece of entertainment reaching out to every viewer in its own specific way.\n\nEastwood&apos;s acting is top notch again, although the years have not been very kind to his voice. The rest of the cast are fine, but one can certainly spot their more amateurish backgrounds here and there which is the main reason why I could not give this one a 10/10.\n\nApart from that there is little to criticize. It&apos;s not an action movie, not a drama movie and certainly not a comedy (even though you get a few laughs out of this one). It&apos;s simply a good story about life.....and death."

            "name": "the enigmas of &apos;Persona&apos;",
            "reviewBody": "&apos;Persona&apos; is one of the most enigmatic movies in the history of cinema. Those who read the chronicles written right after the 1966 release of the film or the articles dedicated to it in the books of cinema history will encounter as many interpretations as authors. The same happens if we read the opinions written by film lovers on sites like IMDB, or we discuss the film between us. Ingmar Bergman had the inspiration not only of not talking a lot about this film (even less than about his other films) but he also avoided sharing too much of his personal thoughts or ideas even with the actresses or the other members of the production team. The result is an enigma. Each of us who sees or sees again this movie has his own Persona&apos;.\n\nThe ambitions are clear from the way the film is &apos;packaged&apos; using the classic projection room effects. Short sequences from classical films emphasize the effect of declaring &apos;here we have a work of cinema&apos;. The prelude sets up an atmosphere that could be defined as a dream, we are clearly in a world that resembles the real world but which exists only in the eyes and souls of the spectators, built with materials put together by the creator of the film from his own thoughts and dreams about the world. The &apos;story&apos; could be told in few words, even if it is not a banal story. This is where the interpretations begin. What do we actually see on the screen? An ambiguous relationship between two women, evolving from a patient-care relationship to an attraction that starts to look as a melding of one into the other? Are the two characters the symbols of the two facets of the human personality - the soul and the character - as interpreted by some experts in the psychoanalysis theories? Is there a hint (or more) to a lesbian relationship? Maybe there is an element of class struggle, between the actress active on the intellectual level and the country girl whose strongest emotions are on the erotic plane? Are we dealing with a horror story, a thriller in which there is a physical threat and a struggle between the two women to gain control one over the other? Why did the actress stop talking - personal traumas, maternity failure? What is the connection between the horrors of the outside world (wars, the Holocaust) and the inner storms concealed by the Scandinavian calm? These are just a few of the questions that can be asked and of the possible interpretations.\n\nComprehensive and ambitious cinematographic constructions involve risks. More than 50 years after the film, the Vietnam War is no longer actuality but history, closer to the Holocaust which is also quoted by the famous photograph of the terrorized little boy in the Warsaw ghetto. The black and white image also gains aesthetic significance, not necessarily obvious and intentional at the time the film was made. Acting is gorgeous, Bergman&apos;s two preferred actresses (and lovers), Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann are building on the screen two versions of femininity that at some point merge one into the other, two variants of the director&apos;s fascination with women for which he created the most generous roles in his films. Seen for the first time or seen again today, &apos;Persona&apos; is a cinematic art concentrate and an intellectual challenge that continues to attract and fascinate through its open character and enigmas.",

            "reviewBody": "Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995), the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That&apos;s it, that&apos;s the movie. It could&apos;ve been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli&apos;s angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.",

            "reviewBody": "In Australia in 1976, a young girl named Mary (voiced by Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely child looking for a friend. She lives with both her parents but her mother is a chain smoking drunk and a thief and her father, who works in a factory putting the strings on teabags, would rather spend time with his collection of dead birds. Mary remains curious about life and finds the address of an American living in New York. She writes him a letter to become his pen pal. The recipient is Max (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a severely overweight Jewish hypochondriac and full-time no-hoper. Gradually, as they send each other letters, Mary and Max&apos;s relationship develops and we begin to learn more about their past and their heartache and insecurities of being alone.\n\nFollowing the short animated film, Harvey Krumpet, director Adam Elliot has constructed his first full feature claymation picture, displaying as much skill as many of the major mainstream studios. The film has been immaculately designed, with many tiny details and features placed into the sets, all of which would have taken many countless hours to mould. The lighting and colour scheme too are significant to the unique look of the film, ranging from highly saturated to almost entirely black and white, to reflect the self-depreciative and sometimes gloomy tone of the narrative. It is a film made of great patience and craftsmanship.\n\nYet the strongest asset of the film is the humour of the screenplay. Whereas many mainstream animated films such as Shrek and The Incredibles adopt a great deal of hilarity from their pop culture references, Elliot has an eye for the simpler things in life. From the way Mary and Max share their eating habits of chocolate hot dogs, to how Max describes his past jobs, including a street cleaner and a member of the Communist Party, the humour of the film remains truly original, bizarre and often very witty. Elliot excels in his ability write about the most normal things and then turn them on their heads, or degrade his miserable characters in the most hilarious way. Yet there are moments of poignancy too, such as where Mary describes her difficulty at school as she is teased for the birthmark on her forehead, that provide the film&apos;s screenplay with a subtext - no matter how simple \u2013 about isolation and the need for friends.\n\nThe use of Barry Humphries&apos; voice over to convey much of the story is initially highly annoying and intrusive. In the opening scenes it feels overly used and distracting from the story and the detail of the scenes. Gradually though, as the film moves from its opening exposition, the voice over is used slightly less and its scarcity achieves the storybook quality and poetry that it deserves. Barry Humphries reads his lines beautifully. The rest of the voice actors too are splendid. Philip Seymour Hoffman is again in fine form, adding a slight accent to his voice and the decision to model his voice with a character of a similar physique fits nicely. He is quickly become one of the most diverse actors in the world. Bethany Whitmore as the young Mary is equally impressive too and her voice has a real innocence about it. Toni Collette and Eric Bana also have much smaller roles too. It is a well thought out voice cast and while some of the minor characters verge on grotesque, there is still a real sweetness about this film that carries it.\n\nElliot has described his film as being suitable for everyone. This is rather optimistic. I don&apos;t know how particularly young children, who have been conditioned by the more mainstream animated titles, would appreciate the film. It is extremely funny for the most part, but there is also a real sense of gloom around these characters that might not be as appealing to children. And towards the end, the film, despite being well under two hours, begins to lose a bit of momentum as the characters wave in and out of their depleted lives. Perhaps the films message of learning to live with your flaws and accepting the path life has given you is something that children, even if they don&apos;t entirely understand now though, needs to be seen anyway. Regardless, it remains a mostly sharp and funny film that many will find refreshing and engaging given the home-grown talent involved.",

            "reviewBody": "On Leonardo DiCaprio&apos;s 31st birthday, I have the pleasure of praising one of the finest actors working today. I didn&apos;t realize what I was seeing when that homeless boy showed up on &apos;Growing Pains&apos;--a show not exactly known for the quality of its actors. And I didn&apos;t see much to like about &quot;Titanic&quot; except the excitement of watching the people evacuating and the ship sinking. Also, &apos;Romeo and Juliet&apos; was just corny, with 400-year-old dialogue in a modern setting.\n\nBut if he could be nominated for his &apos;Aviator&apos; performance, DiCaprio must be doing something right. And here he shows us what he is capable of. Especially when Frank Jr. is conning people, and most of all when he tries to outwit Hanatty. I am reminded of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, or perhaps Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;. The strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes a long way toward making this movie work.\n\nFrank Jr. showed a lot of intelligence, and DiCaprio effectively showed us what this man could do. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed on the right side of the law. But his life on the run was more fun to watch.\n\nTom Hanks, as popular as he is, can be commended for his willingness to play second banana for a change. And he did a fine job. Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken also made an impact here.\n\nI loved the old cars and the even older songs. The clip from &apos;To Tell the Truth&apos; was a nice touch. The theme song still gives me a craving for vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years (I didn&apos;t feel I had time to watch the new version).\n\nThis was Oscar-caliber. Too bad the Academy Awards people didn&apos;t seem to agree."

            "reviewBody": "Critics of &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; will call it cheesy, saccharine, and over-the-top in its character portrayals. Truth be told, I really can&apos;t call those critiques &quot;wrong&quot;. But the thing is, this is such an endearing, aspirational film that I&apos;m always able to look past the cheese-factor and enjoy the performances and overall message.\n\nFor a very basic overview, &apos;Mr. Smith Goes To Washington&quot; tells the story of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a wide-eyed, aww-shucks, country boy rube who gets nominated for a U. S. Senate seat in large part to be a straight-ticket voter for the political machine of Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). Once in Washington, however, both get a rude awakening: Smith discovers the graft in politics, while Paine begins to realize--to his horror--that Smith isn&apos;t just going to &quot;tow the party line&quot;.\n\nThis movie remains an all-time classic for me because of the earnestness of its message. It isn&apos;t quite as perfect as Capra&apos;s more famous &quot;It&apos;s A Wonderful Life&quot;, but I do see similarities between the two pictures. Here, the story strikes such a simple--yet highly emotional--chord. Though deep down I think we all realize that corruption and compromise are likely unavoidable aspects of politics, we like to cling to ideals of honesty and supreme integrity. That is precisely the journey that Smith takes viewers on. This isn&apos;t &quot;politics as it is&quot;, but rather &quot;politics as we want it to be&quot;, and I think there is equal room for both in politically-minded films.\n\nOf course, casting Stewart is the cherry on top of all this. I&apos;m not sure there has been a better individual born to play the Jefferson Smith role. His stuttering, stammering, &quot;golly gee whiz&quot; routine is perfect, yet when the chips are down he delivers a filibuster monologue almost guaranteed to have you in tears. Rains is fine as the corrupt Senator and Jean Arthur has a nice sidekick supporting role, but &quot;Mr. Smith Goes To Washington&quot; is memorable because of Stewart. I very much liken his performance here to that of Henry Fonda&apos;s in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. It&apos;s what we all wish we could be like--but know we&apos;ll probably never quite get there.\n\nThe only reason I can&apos;t give this a full 10 stars? It was made in 1939--or back when Hollywood didn&apos;t really know how to properly end movies other than an emotional flourish and a fade to black. With a less-rushed, more nuanced endgame, this one could have ascended even higher.\n\nOverall, though, I consider this to be one of my favorite political films of all time. Make all the gritty, tough governmental thrillers you want (I love some of those too!), but I hold steady that a more aspirational, positive-minded effort like this isn&apos;t out-of-date or irrelevant simply because of that nature.",

I&apos;ve never seen a film with photography that even begins to approach that in Barry Lyndon. But everyone mentions the photography. The three things that most decisively set this film apart from all of Kubrick&apos;s others and really haven&apos;t been mentioned enough are its enormous heart, its uncompromising spirit, and the way it seems to suspend time over and over again, simultaneously standing still yet flowing along easily, almost breathlessly. If you watch it expecting A Clockwork Orange or The Shining, you&apos;ll be very disappointed and may end up calling it long and boring, but if you set aside an entire evening and surrender yourself totally to its magic, I swear you&apos;ll be looking for yourself in Stunland a few hours later. I&apos;s time to treat yourself to Barry Lyndon. You may be shocked at discovering what&apos;s been there for so long.",

Belfast guy Gerry Conlon is suspected of being one of the IRA terrorists responsible for a bomb in Guilford, London, in 1974, which killed several people. He spends 15 years in jail, fighting for his innocence and for truth.\n\nAfter working with Daniel Day Lewis in &quot;My left foot&quot;, director Jim Sheridan teams again with the actor for this drama. The strong cast is completed by Emma Thomson and Pete Postlewaite. The result is a brilliant, passionate feature which tells about injustice. It&apos;s a disquieting film.\n\nThis is doubtless the most achieved collaboration between the director and the main star. The other pictures as well are very good, but here we have a film of accusation -the story is more involving. Day Lewis performance in &quot;My left foot&quot; was awarded with an Oscar, but the actor could have been given the same prize for his play of Gerry Conlon.\n\nStrong screenplay, actors and soundtrack -with music of Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer and songs of Irish stars Bono and Sinead O&apos;Connor.",

Costas Gavras did his best to present the prevailing atmosphere and the political situation in Greece ( although Greece is at no point straightly mentioned, but implied ) during May of the year 1963, which is the year when the real events took place. Choosing an adventurous, thrilling or hilarious style according to the facts and scenes presenting at each part of the story, he made an &apos;&apos; all time interesting and provocative &apos;&apos; film. Great acting was also put in by everybody and particularly by Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was great as the Examining Magistrate. As long as the script is concerned, the plot builds up very satisfactorily and carefully, thus not leaving any holes. Great respect should also be paid to Mikis Theodorakis who wrote the original score for the movie, helping it gain the marvelous rythm it retained right until the very end of it. As a concluding remark I would like to mention that anybody who&apos;s interested in late Greek history ( from post World War II era to date ) should watch it carefully. The whole result is very rewarding.",

            "reviewBody": "When thinking about war films, it&apos;s very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.\n\nSome war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.\n\nDesmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss&apos; phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.\n\nHacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.\n\nGibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It&apos;s the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss&apos; arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.\n\nSpeaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you&apos;ll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they&apos;re wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.\n\nComing to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it&apos;s great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.\n\nThe supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I&apos;d see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.\n\nFew films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that&apos;s why I have to say it&apos;s a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It&apos;s right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.",

I&apos;ll go so far as to say that if you don&apos;t cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don&apos;t have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I&apos;ve ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP).

            "reviewBody": "What can one say about this work of art that has not been said many times before by those far better qualified to explain both it&apos;s importance and place as cinema and art? I shall not comment on the greatness of the film&apos;s technical achievements; the stunning cinematography, the production design, the brilliance of the screenplay based on actual transcripts from the trial, or the perfection of Mr. Dreyer&apos;s direction. The performance of Falconetti as Jeanne d&apos; Arc has a profundity and depth far beyond my ability to illuminate. I suppose the best I can hope to do is to share my feelings, however inadequately expressed, of the effect it had on me. To say that it may be the greatest film ever made is to sound both obvious and trite. That a work of such beauty and simplicity, made seventy-six years ago can still have the power to move audiences in an era of multi-million dollar, hi-tech, bombastic over-wrought cinematic drivel is in itself a testament to the vision and genius of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Maria Falconetti and their collaborators. It is nourishment for those that hunger for something more in cinema, a feast for the soul. It is a reminder that film can indeed be art, and this film like all great works of art, lifts and transports us from the routine of our work-a-day lives to enable us, if only for a moment to experience the sublime. When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror. That is to say we look into ourselves. We question ourselves as to our own beliefs, or the lack thereof and the strength of spirit that enables an individual to endure the unendurable. Viewing it is a profound experience the nature of which for myself is transcendent rather than religious, because I am not in the least a religious person. Transcendent because it evokes emotions and thoughts that I cannot wholly account for, or adequately explain.\n\n&quot;La Passion of Jeanne d&apos;Arc&quot; is stark, radiant, exalted, simple, (but never simplistic), and ultimately sublime. The rest is silence.",

            "reviewBody": "A random and encounter has led Solomon Northup from living freely in New York to being kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana, getting handed over to various slave owners. There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.\n\nAs I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of &quot;Django Unchained&quot; and &quot;The Butler&quot;. But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen&apos;s &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors&apos; faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn&apos;t just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer&apos;s poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender&apos;s portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.",

            "reviewBody": "Beneath all the one-liners and amusing gags, this classic comedy has an undertone of satire that is quite effective. Jack Benny plays his role with just the right amount of exaggeration for it to work perfectly, and he, Carole Lombard, and the rest of the cast help Ernst Lubitsch to tell a lively yet worthwhile tale. There are a few slow spots early in the movie, but after it hits its stride, everything fits together well.\n\nVery few film-makers can make something like this succeed, because they take themselves too seriously. Lubitsch does not, and as a result this film provides a caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal of the Nazis, with a light-hearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them in the occupied countries. The right kind of lighter touch can sometimes be more effective in commenting on important issues than the heavy, emotionally laden harangues that are all too common.\n\nWhile providing good entertainment, this movie also brings out the Nazis&apos; inherent insecurity, pettiness, and short-sightedness, while also demonstrating their growing capacity for destroying the innocent. For example, the wonderful character actor Sig Ruman is greatly entertaining as a Nazi bureaucrat, yet he also cleverly brings out the pathetic side of such persons.\n\nAside from a couple of good gags, it starts off just a little slowly. A lot of time is spent on Robert Stack&apos;s character, who is (through no fault of Stack&apos;s) not very interesting. Likewise, the subplot involving him and Lombard takes up a lot more time than it was worth. Other than that, though, it moves briskly, with many entertaining scenes while it develops the story. As the pace picks up, the members of Benny&apos;s acting troupe get some fine moments of their own, Benny himself has some fine scenes with several other characters, and everything builds up nicely towards a good finale."

I simply can&apos;t begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic pop-poetry, as it plates gold on the silver screen, and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequence Busbee Berkley musical numbers are unique and awe-inspiring; the humor is rich, subtle, and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance; the free-flowing story avoids (even pokes fun at) nonessentials like plot points and pay-offs. But what really makes this film such a masterpiece, such a panacea, is the incredible humanism, the care that the Coen brothers put in developing The Dude (Jeff Bridges), Walter (John Goodman), Donnie (Steve Buscemi-tremendously endearing), and Brandt (magnificently played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Looking at the films use of Sam Elliott to play The Stranger, who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude (among other things), it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life. And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick, stylistic show-off films, what more could one ask for than a good-hearted film like this? Not to mention the performance by Jeff Bridges, which ranks among the best performances of the nineties; he has a relaxed slouch, a goofy smile, an enthusiastic dance, and his buttons can only be pushed by Walter, who John Goodman plays with charm and fury. The Coen brothers have always been considered &apos;cold&apos; filmmakers, but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity (as is the case with the Coens&apos; Fargo). What we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you can&apos;t see that, grab a White Russian, hit the bowling ally, and find your inner-Dude as soon as possible."

Now I&apos;ve seen it again and watched Peter Weir&apos;s filming and timing which is also great. Robin Williams is a terrific actor when he&apos;s serious. He proved it in Good Will Hunting but he proved it first here. If you liked that movie and your liking it had something to do with Williams than you will like this one. The plot is about a number of students who are taught by Williams about life. They are taught how to enjoy themselves. This ends up causing great controversy among the heads of the school. The students are terrific and even the dialogue is great. This is a movie that I can&apos;t imagine anyone not liking. It is good in every way."

I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn&apos;t the original plot. Even for those who haven&apos;t read the books (why wouldn&apos;t you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.",

Even the late CH has become more a societal joke and less of an icon over time. Michael Moore made Heston&apos;s participation in the NRA a joke. (If Heston&apos;s concerns over where society is headed prove to be true, the final joke may be on Moore.) Back to the film. It is almost perfect. Then, as now. The script continually builds. Modern writers could learn from that. No matter what is presently on screen as you watch, the inevitability of the final climax beckons.\n\nThe acting is perfect.\n\nThe mixture of myth and drama is perfect.\n\nTrue the Roman dialog did not benefit from the verbal tricks that Stephen McKnight used in Spartacus (bending the script to match the flow of actual Roman) but it is more than enough to entertain and entrance.\n\nFrom the &quot;accident&quot; early in the film which starts the flow of events, to the chariot race WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN EQUALLED IN THE HISTORY OF FILM, to the reunion with lost family at the end, this is one of the most powerful and entertaining films of all time",

            "reviewBody": "An animated feast for the eyes is a brilliant description for this film. From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didn&apos;t disappoint.\n\nOur protagonist is Hiccup, a boy viking who doesn&apos;t possess much in common with his dragon slaying dad. However, when he finds a new friend in Toothless, the most feared dragon of its species, he learns that dragons are not the fearful creatures he was brought up to believe.\n\nWhat I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon. This was dealt with wonderfully and we see their relationship develop over a series of scenes which were done with great humour and action.\n\nThe 3D holds its own in every sense, and I would go as far as saying that some scenes rival the groundbreaking Avatar. The scenes that especially stood out were the flying segments where the dragon soars over crystal clear sea&apos;s and jaw-dropping backdrops.\n\nWhilst this is a film that may seem as if it&apos;s solely directed at the younger generation, its stunning visuals and well-told story means that it will keep any adult satisfied.",

            "reviewBody": "Before she was an international star of incomparable charisma and beauty, and even before Ingmar Bergman became a legendary director of films bleak and intense, Ingrid Bergman played in the Swedish cinema. So it is entirely apropos that someday Bergman might direct Bergman. \n\nIngrid plays Charlotte, a concert pianist who has, upon the recent death of her longtime lover, Leonardo, returned to her native land to visit her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann), whom she hasn&apos;t seen for seven years, and her husband Viktor (Halvar Bjork), who is a minister. Ullmann is frumpish in specs with her hair up and her dress loose and ill-fitting. She is Ingrid&apos;s nerdish daughter who has been throughout her life entirely overshadowed by her glamorous mother. Eva has an unpleasant surprise for mom. Her other daughter, Helena (Lena Nyman), who suffers from a crippling disease, perhaps muscular dystrophy, is on hand. Eva didn&apos;t tell her mother that Helena was now living with them. She says she didn&apos;t tell her because she knew that, if she had, Charlotte would not have come. And so we can guess that there are issues that will come out, issues between mother and daughter that have been festering for decades.\n\nI got goose bumps seeing Ingrid Bergman as an elderly woman, and seeing the smooth, graceful style again, the elegant presence, a hint of the old gestures, the sly glances, the tentative smiles... It was really wonderful and at the same time disconcerting to examine her face (Sven Nykvist&apos;s intense close ups expose every inch of skin) and sigh and remember and understand the effect of the passing years. Ingrid is elegant but she has been robbed of her beauty so now we are able to see her character; unfortunately Ingmar&apos;s script allows little of the real Ingrid Bergman to appear. Hers is not a pleasant part to play. She is an entirely selfish and self-centered woman who has put her career before her family, but is unaware of what she has done. Eva seizes this opportunity to punish her mother by dredging up the neglect of her childhood to throw it in her mother&apos;s face (which perhaps explains why Charlotte hasn&apos;t been home in seven years). The sheer cold hatred that Eva expresses is enough to make the devil himself cringe. After a bit one begins to feel sorry for Charlotte, despite her failures as a mother, to have a daughter so unforgiving and so hateful.\n\nLiv Ullmann is rather startling in this portrayal, with her penetrating eyes, her hard, Neandethalish forehead, the severe specs, and the uncompromising tone of her voice. Charlotte is ashamed and begs for forgiveness and tries to defend herself, but it is no use. Eva is too strong for her. This is one of the more intense scenes in cinema, and one not easily watched. Meanwhile in the upstairs bedroom and then in the hallway and down the staircase, Helena has heard them arguing and is pulling her crippled body over the floor, desperately trying to reach them. She cries out, &quot;Mama! Mama!&quot; but is not heard.\n\nViewers might want to pick sides between mother and daughter to say which is the more at fault. Indeed, it is hard to say who Bergman himself found more at fault. Perhaps there is no fault, only human weakness and stupidity. Such scenes are usually followed by a greater understanding, forgiveness and a willingness to start anew. However, although Charlotte wants that, it is not clear in Bergman&apos;s script that anything good will come of what has happened. Charlotte leaves, the minister returns to looking at his wife, (having overheard the argument, about which he has said nothing) and Eva writes a letter to her mother. It is not clear whether she wants to patch things up or to gain another opportunity to pick her mother to pieces. The viewer is left to decide.\n\nPerhaps the best scene in the film is the one that follows dinner the night of Charlotte&apos;s arrival in which Eva plays the piano, a Chopin prelude. She has worked hard on it and hopes to please her mother. Alas, her play is not so good. After all, the mother is a genius, the daughter only the daughter of a genius. Charlotte sits down next to Eva and takes the keys to gently demonstrate how the piece should be played. We see and feel at once the inadequacy of the daughter in her mother&apos;s eyes. It is a great scene filmed with a tight focus on the faces of the two women. When Eva turns to stare at her mother, who is, of course, playing brilliantly with great finesse and touch, the expression on Eva&apos;s face, held for many long seconds, is unforgettable.\n\nNot to second guess the master, but I would have liked to have seen the entire movie played in this, a more subtle key than that which followed. However when it comes to dysfunction and disease, Ingmar Bergman is unrestrained.\n\nIngrid Bergman was nominated for an academy award for best actress in this, her last feature film (she had already been diagnosed with cancer), but lost out to Jane Fonda in Coming Home (1978).\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &quot;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&apos;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&quot; Get it at Amazon!)",

As an actor, I had my reservations with him, but as a storyteller, I have truly inhaled him. &apos;Million Dollar Baby&apos; is amongst his finest films, a superb film, that almost reaches a Landmark level!\n\nAbout a hardened trainer/manager works with a determined woman in her attempt to establish herself as a boxer. &apos;Million Dollar Baby&apos; begins with some humor, then it improves itself into becoming a motivational punch, but ends as a dry and depressing saga. I adored almost everything about the film, except the final 20-25 minutes. The culmination is very depressing. In fact, one just doesn&apos;t imagine it would have to end this way! But in all fairness, this one is a winner! \n\nEastwood&apos;s understanding to the subject is objective and that&apos;s biggest plus point. Tom Stern&apos;s Cinematography is splendid. Joel Cox&apos;s editing is razor-sharp.\n\nIn the acting department, Hilary Swank delivers a Knock-out performance. She is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman is wonderfully restrained. Eastwood&apos;s performance, is a pure of example, of apt multi-tasking. Jay Baruchel as Danger, is flawless. Anthony Mackie is his usual self. Brian F. O&apos;Byrne is passable.\n\nOn the whole, the list of accolades this 2004 flick received is truly unprecedented. It&apos;s got a legendary tag. From this writer, Thumbs Up!",

            "reviewBody": "Clouzot rarely gets the attention he deserves. He made not one, but two of the greatest thrillers of all time, &apos;Les Diaboliques&apos; and &apos;The Wages Of Fear&apos;, both perfect examples of how to make genuinely suspenseful movies that build up an amazing amount of tension.  Most so-called thrillers made in Hollywood these days are thrillers in name only and could learn a lesson or two from these movie classics. &apos;The Wages Of Fear&apos; could even be described as an action movie, but it is a CHARACTER DRIVEN action movie, and that&apos;s what makes it so special. Modern audiences with MTV attention spans might find the plot a little slow, but I think the first half of the movie, which deals with the motley collection of exiles in a poor Latin American town, is not only fascinating in itself, but really makes a massive impact on the second half. By taking his time introducing the characters and exploring their relationships and possible motivations, Clouzet adds depth and meaning to the rest of the exciting story, something very rarely achieved in this type of movie since. The cast, every single one of them, are flawless. The four leads, Mario, the fairly decent guy played by yves Montand, his new best friend the shifty M. Jo (Charles Vanel), his old pal the kind hearted Luigi (Folco Lulli), and the enigmatic Bimba (Peter van Eyck), are all brilliant. Great performances, taut and imaginative direction, crisp and impressive cinematography, and a handful of the most riveting sequences ever committed to film make &apos;Wages Of Fear&apos; a truly unforgettable experience. Suspense movies don&apos;t come much better than this! Simply a masterpiece."

What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix&apos;s acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. &apos;Stand By Me&apos; is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it&apos;s style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it&apos;s message and it&apos;s wonderful acting.",

            "reviewBody": "The controversial film from Korean master Chan-wook Park evokes the sexiness of Abdellatif Kechiche&apos;s &quot;Blue is the Warmest Colour&quot; and Park&apos;s own signature violence and thrills. Set in the 1930s Japanese occupied Korea, it&apos;s a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Min-hee Kim). However, she must manage to convince the heiress to marry a conman (Jung-woo Ha) who poses as a count, for which she will get a chance for a better life. She gets into a moral dilemma when she starts developing feelings for the heiress.\n\nThe Handmaiden is a triumph on every level. The film is divided into three chapters, all giving different perspective. This way, the story is perfectly structured to give more and more insight as the film progresses, but at the same time, keep the viewers guessing. It offers a few surprises along the way as well. Visually, it&apos;s a feast for the eyes. The term &quot;every frame a painting&quot; gets overused, but it really fits here. I&apos;m not only talking about cinematography, which offered plenty of memorable shots and beautiful scenery, but the costume and set design. The three leads all gave terrific performances. Musical score by Yeong-wook evokes, or better said, amplifies the emotions and the suspenseful tone. Despite the run time of 2 hours and 24 minutes, it never gets dull, it&apos;s very evenly paced throughout. I couldn&apos;t look away for a second.\n\nOne thing needs to be addressed, the film is quite explicit. That being said, it never gets vulgar, the sex scenes are done in perfect taste, they never feel out of place and they&apos;re not there just for the sake of it. The relationship between the characters and the physical presentation of it are integral to the film. It&apos;s a film about passion, abuse, jealousy, betrayal and deception, but most of all, it&apos;s an atypical love story, which will make one love and hate the protagonists at the same time. It&apos;s original and daring work of art that will stick with viewers long after it&apos;s finished.\n\nWhenever Chan-wook Park makes a film, it must undoubtedly be compared to his masterpiece, &quot;Oldboy&quot;. I don&apos;t think that &quot;The Handmaiden&quot; surpasses it, but it comes very close. With this film, he proved himself to be one of the greatest working directors today. It&apos;s the best film I&apos;ve seen this year, one that I can&apos;t wait to revisit. It&apos;s not to be missed.",

            "reviewBody": "La Haine aka Hate is a story about three friends living near Paris in France (one Jew, one Arab and one black) who have nothing special in their lives and try to live a day at a time by drinking and having a good time and also working (at least the black character, who owns a boxing hall). Their friend, however, is captured by a police which tortures and maltreats him so badly that he is sent to a hospital in a critical condition. This makes the youth gangs in city including the three protagonists start a war against the police and authorities for the horrible wrongs they and their friend have suffered, and suddenly they notice the whole society is collapsing, and all there is is hate and need to revenge...Violence and mayhem is almost everywhere, including authorities which should do nothing but fight against it..\n\nThis film is powerful and grim. Totally unforgettable is the last scene which at my first viewing time blew me away. It comes very suddenly and there are no warnings what will happen at the end of this film. The message is so important and these marks of the &quot;apocalypse&quot; can be found in our everyday life everywhere. The society is falling and it is &quot;spinning&quot; as the voice over says just before the end credits..The film brings into question such horrific facts as racism which should have passed away long times ago, but no. Racism is such a primitive, stupid and despisable cancer among people, that there is no hope of better future if individuals don&apos;t understand the real facts of life and right ways to live with each other. Hate feeds hate as the character Hubert says, and that is something that our stupid race has not learned.\n\nThere is one very powerful scene just before the end scene and it deals with a skinhead and these three characters who could kill him right away and pay something back. It is very challenging scene and even Vinz, the most revenge seeking character, starts to see things different way after that. The whole point of La Haine is violence in all its forms. Why there is violence and why the hell it is used so often everywhere in every form? Don&apos;t we ever learn? These kind of films are important and so powerful that unfortunately people who should see them don&apos;t want to or they can&apos;t bacause it would be as a mirror for them..\n\nThe film is also a comment on power used by police as they are pretty tough and hard in this film. Police think that they can use any methods in order to get some answers, or in order to have some fun..It certainly doesn&apos;t judge police as &quot;pigs&quot; or violent sadists in general, but it is a warning example of what must NOT happen anywhere ever, by police or by others. One has to see through the film and to its core in order to understand what it says. Otherwise there is no point in watching these kind of films. La Haine is that kind of a film that it should be seen by police and youths as well, because there are still possibilities to prevent things to go too far in our life and world we live in.\n\nThe camera techniques used in this film are magnificent. Director/screenwriter Mathieu Kassovitz uses camera so smoothly and passionately and there are many similarities in techniques between this film and his more recent, Assassin(s). I am very happy for this young talent to have won the director&apos;s award at Cannes. These kind of talents deserve their prizes because there are so many stupid and worthless films which don&apos;t have nothing artistic in them and have nothing to say, and are just mindless and greedy entertainment. The black and white is very great element and the film strikes greatly without colors. The same case is with the Belgian classic Man Bites Dog, by Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde and Andre Bonzel.\n\n A great masterpiece in French modern cinema and recommended for the fans of intelligent and important cinema so seldom found from big studios or Hollywood (there are exceptions, of course) nowadays.\n\n10/10",

            "reviewBody": "Another, fantastic, Brilliant work of art by Kyoto Animation alongside Trigger studio, MadHouse and of course Studio Ghibli and many more theses are the studios that lead the anime world, In my opinion. Koe no katachi or A silent voice is honestly one of my favorite anime alongside Spirited Away from the animation alone is brilliant, when I first saw the trailer I feel in love and knew it was going to be up there as one of my favorite but actually seeing, the story is well done, follows the Manga well, the Manga characters are explored a lot more in depth then the movie but the movie is like 2 hours 10 minutes long it would be difficult to add 7 volumes worth of content into that time frame but Kyoto Animations did the manga justice, I would recommend the Manga author/artist Oima Yoshitoki its a brilliant Manga I would beyond recommend the anime its doesn&apos;t matter what one you read/watch first the movie covers the main bulk of the manga. In my opinion one of the best movies, it has sensitive subject matters but deals with them with respect and such a beautiful message when you watch the films I would also recommend looking more into reviews and other views on it and theory&apos;s they really make you...Smile :)\n\nStory. 10/10 As I said before sensitive subjects, well executed though.\n\nAnimation. 10/10 Its Kyoto Animations...I will leave it at that. \n\nMusic. 10/10 Yeah brilliant the opening was unexpected but not unwelcome, the tone change that happens after the opening was brilliant and the music throughout was fantastic. \n\nCharacters. 10/10 (As I said manga goes in more depth but the movie goes into the characters quite well you feel like you understand motives etc.) Also I bow to the voice actress of Nishimiya Sh\u014dko (Saori Hayami)just beautiful. \n\nEnjoyment. 10/10 I&apos;ll be honest I cried, like four times but that is just me I get emotional with my anime but still didn&apos;t stop me loving this anime in fact I love it even more. listen I just cant get enough of this anime just. WELL DONE!",

This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke&apos;.  We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours.  It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien&apos;) live vicariously through him.\n\nFilled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin&apos; it here boss&apos;, the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash part) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history&apos;s most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic.  Released the same year as `Bonnie and Clyde&apos;, it makes one long for the days when you needed a real script to make a movie."

            "reviewBody": "Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog&apos;s Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.\n\nBefore my last year&apos;s visit to Tokyo I&apos;ve been unaware of the true-life story this movie is based upon. In time an occasion came up to meet a friend in Shibuya city, contemporary center of Tokyo&apos;s youth culture (shopping, fashion, nightlife...), and that&apos;s how I&apos;ve learned about the popular local meeting point for all Tokyoites, the Hachik\u014d Akita dog statue just outside of Shibuya Train Station, but the real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since. After seeing this movie, and some additional research on the web, all pieces have fallen into place.\n\nIn retelling the story of common bonding between the dog and its owner, so usual that it comes so natural, film is moving at slow pace, following events of an ordinary life, though not without occasional comedic and dramatic overtones. Even past the dramatic highpoint, when common acts of affection and loyalty evolve towards such an unheard-of faithfulness and ultimate devotion, pace of the storytelling does not change, relying primarily on fine details and emotional build-up. Of course, this might not attract everybody, providing that majority of movie audience today is highly dependent on fast paced, action packed scenes, getting thrills from 3D CG stylized ambiance and suspense, high volume amplitudes and aggressive, often rude highlights of any other nature. However, for those who can do without it, and keep alive their interest even in a simple story, who won&apos;t shy away from emotional involvement (as if this can be controlled), they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty and warmth. Usual man&apos;s-best-friend story, spiced with an intriguing yet inspiring detail, shall leave you a bit sad, inevitably pensive, but ultimately delighted. Even more so after the reading of the real-life epilogue.",

And final cherry on the acting caked is Nawazzuddin as a vulnerable young lad who is basically a romantic at heart but is getting transformed into a ruthless gangster much like Michael Corleone in the Godfather series. \n\nManoj Bajpayee&apos;s character is quite akin to much more ruthless version of Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando in &apos;The Godfather&apos;.\n\nBy repeatingly mentioning &apos;The Godfather&apos; I am not trying to take away anything from GOW. GOW is a superb film which needs to be watched by anyone and everyone who has the slightest of respect and love for films and filmmaking.\n\nSneha Khawalker&apos;s rockingtingly superb music brings a whole new level of excitement in the film and Rajeev Ravi&apos;s cinematography is very very efficient, sprinkled with quite a few shots of sheer brilliance.\n\nAll this make a nice, superbly tasty biryani and the credit can only go the masterchef Mr.Anurag Kashyap.\n\n8/10, and I&apos;d defo recommend all my friends to go and watch this film in CINEMAS!",

            "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen this film about five times over the last twenty-five years.  As narrative, this film is quite boring.  I can never become involved with or care much for its characters.  It is a depressing picture of a twelve-year-old boy who is trapped by parents and teachers, by public school, and by reform school.  An American film about this subject in 1959--the year of this film--would either have tried to squeeze a tear from the audience&apos;s eye or would have tried to arouse the audience to action, and would have been presented to the audience as a sensational expose of juvenile delinquency.  This film just presents its story in a straightforward, objective, slice-of-life manner.  I think that&apos;s why it&apos;s so depressing.\n\nSince I know Truffaut is a fan of Hitchcock, I thought some of the narrative line might have grown out of an episode Hitchcock often related--how his father had him locked up in jail overnight as a youth to teach him a lesson.\n\nI feel this film is worth more as an historical item than as entertainment. For this reason, it should be taught in film courses and will have a certain impact on young, first-time viewers.  Historically, it&apos;s important (1) as a film that helped form the French New Wave; (2) because Truffaut went on to become an important film director and this film is autobiographical; (3) as the first of the Antoine Doinel series, Doinel being a cinematic semi-autobiographical figure for Truffaut.  Actually, I have been bored to varying degrees by all the Doinel films and find Jean-Pierre Leaud, who plays Doniel in &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; as well as the other films in the series, to be a nincompoop.\n\nThe technique in this film is very like the Italian neo-realist films, especially a film like &quot;Open City.&quot;  It&apos;s shot in low-contrast black and white, it&apos;s shot in actual locations around Paris; it presents a slice of life.\n\nDespite all I&apos;ve written above, I&apos;ve seen many Truffaut films that I&apos;ve liked very much (Shoot the Piano Player, Jules and Jim, The Soft Skin, The Bride Wore Black, Mississippi Mermaid (complete version), The Woman Next Door, among others) but not the Antoine Doniel films."

            "reviewBody": "Platoon is generally regarded as one of the strongest anti-war films of all time. While this is certainly true, what&apos;s often overlooked -- at least after only one run through the film -- is that it&apos;s chiefly a tale of God vs. Satan, and the war is there to set a perilous backdrop. No doubt, Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose.\n\nThe story is told from the point of view of Chris Taylor (solidly played by Charlie Sheen), a middle class kid who goes to Vietnam to do what he thinks is his patriotic duty. In the first ten minutes, Chris is shown in the uncomfortable jungle, struggling just to survive in the natural environment, let alone do any actual damage to the enemy. Quickly we&apos;re introduced to the well-known facets of the Vietnam War: The lack of sense of purpose, the wraith-like enemies, the obvious prevalence of the uneducated and poor among the fighting grunts -- and, soon, we see how these factors combine to cause widespread low morale and some actions of more than questionable ethical value.\n\nChris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). These two really are the driving force behind the film. They both have nominally the same enemy (the Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn&apos;t take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the &quot;enemy&quot; does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all -- it&apos;s an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). I won&apos;t deny it is a very black-vesus-white relationship, but this polarity does not feel contrived. Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really -- as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself -- they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.\n\nElias/Barnes&apos; hold on the platoon, and the viewer, is developed through several war sequences. A chilling scene takes place in a village, where our soldiers find no VC, but they do find a cache of VC weapons. The inhumanity of certain soldiers, including of Sgt. Barnes, is unflinchingly shown here. It leaves the viewer with an empty feeling that is hard to shake, reminding of the similarly empty look on a woman&apos;s face after she sees her son killed in front her.\n\nElias doesn&apos;t take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.\n\nDon&apos;t watch this movie for the action. That&apos;s not to say it&apos;s not well shot, or unrealistic. On the contrary. It&apos;s quite convincing. But it doesn&apos;t show war as a fun sport, and it&apos;s never a question of good guys versus bad guys. There will be no cheering for the &quot;good guys&quot; or anyone else in this one. Stone succeeds brilliantly at putting the viewer into the middle of it all, and it&apos;s not a pretty sigh (and definitely not for the squeamish, either).\n\nOn the other hand, if you want great acting, it&apos;s here. Dafoe and Berenger do incredibly well, with the incredibly good (and seemingly authentically sounding) script. Barnes is horrific as he challenges three men to kill him, drinking hard liquor out of the bottle. They don&apos;t make a move, and neither will you, though you&apos;ll hate him just as much as them. Dafoe is a ray of light in the dark as Elias. The cast is rounded out with many characters, all well played, and adding another dimension to the film.\n\nThe technical aspects of the film are superb, though one never thinks about them much, as the movie is completely engrossing. The production values seem quite good, as well. The most stunning peripheral aspect of this film, however, is the music. It&apos;s emotional and draining, and used to great effect -- listen for the main theme as you watch the village burn.\n\nWatch this one a few times, and you&apos;ll likely be quite moved each time. I&apos;ll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 9/10",

The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.\n\nKeaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered. \n\nJust brilliant.",

It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; is entertainment at its bests.\n\nThe voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.\n\nThe story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.\n\nThere is some great dialog but the true power of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!\n\nPure entertainment for the entire family!\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Joan Fontaine (Oscar-nominated) has just married the very wealthy Laurence Olivier (also Oscar-nominated), but she is haunted by his mysterious housekeeper (a show-stopping Oscar-nominated performance by Judith Anderson) and the memory of the film&apos;s titled character (Olivier&apos;s late wife). Hitchcock, noted for his subtle sexual under-tones in films spares none of that here as Anderson&apos;s character and the late titled character&apos;s relationship seemed to go much further than employee-employer. Anderson slowly tries to drive Fontaine to insanity and the end she may accomplish her devious goal. Hitchcock&apos;s first real major U.S. debut stunned the Academy and audiences alike and would lead to the coveted Best Picture Oscar. It is not the best film the legendary director ever worked on, but it is still an amazingly good production that works on many cinematic levels. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

Tough - I&apos;m going to: John Cleese as the legionnary Latin teacher rebuking Brian not for daring to use graffiti on the Roman fort but for using the wrong tense, Michael Palin trying to find his place in life as an ex-leper, Terry Jones as Brian&apos;s mother trying to protect him from myrrh - let&apos;s face it, we&apos;ve all wondered what myrrh is ! The bit that always makes me laugh without fail is something that isn&apos;t always noticed - when Michael Palin is having a go at the guards; &quot;Do you find it risible when I say the name of my friend Biggus Diccus ?&quot; if you look carefully you&apos;ll see that Palin is trying really hard not to laugh.\n\nPuerile, silly but also very very clever. This film doesn&apos;t criticise religion or Jesus in any way ( what was wrong with the people who tried to ban it ? ) - it&apos;s just asking what it could have been like in a society that was expecting the Messiah to show up at any moment, and covering it in a massive coating of comedy.\n\nThis film is an absolute classic - 10 out of 10.",

            "reviewBody": "It&apos;s easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love to be Wong Kar-Wai&apos;s best film. The toned down appeal of the film, centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer, is a retread into Happy Together territory but without the hyper-kinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark of Kar-Wai&apos;s films since Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh&apos;s The Limey, this is a different kind of curio for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis.\n\nIt&apos;s a testament to the genius of Kar-Wai that he is capable to making such a simple tale so resonating. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next-door to each other within the same apartment building. He&apos;s a journalist who dreams of publishing martial-arts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company. Their eventual coupling is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that Kar-Wai ambiguously paints such a journey with his grand masterstrokes.\n\nThe key to the success of the film is Kar-Wai&apos;s use of the interior space, playing with foreground and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of Polanski. During the wooingly sensuous first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. Kar-Wai is concerned with environment and space here, creating a cramped emotional dynamic between his characters. It&apos;s also telling that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen&apos;s spouses. Their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film, as they are tending to their own love affairs with each other.\n\nThis is not to suggest that In the Mood for Love is a confining experience because Kar-Wai manages to inundate his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. There is one shot where Cheung&apos;s slow, sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into Leung&apos;s descent down the very same stairwell; their movements perfectly compliment each other, bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two star-crossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity.\n\nOther scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slow-motion shots of Cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings, set to Mike Galasso&apos;s hauntingly beautiful score. Cheung&apos;s dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings. Her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely sub-conscious.\n\nIf I make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing pheromones on each other, it probably isn&apos;t that far-fetched of a statement. The tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors. The film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. Kar-Wai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch, shattering the couple&apos;s proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their love lust, often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have glided near each other.\n\nKar-Wai&apos;s hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed Leung&apos;s Lai Yu-Fai to experience a cathartic release in Happy Together, even if Leslie Cheung&apos;s Ho Po-wing was not there to enjoy it with him. By that film&apos;s end, love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third man&apos;s muted declarations of love signaled Yu-Fai&apos;s realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if it would not bring him back his lover. Mo-Wan&apos;s journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple. His own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country, and the absence of Li-szhen is only made tolerable by the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a release of sorts. Mo-Wan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.",

            "reviewBody": "I have no doubt that this is the only movie for the past year that can get me totally, if not 101%, emotionally involved. For other movies, I might be interacting with the story a lot , say associating my personal experiences with the characters, making judgment on them, criticizing the development of the story, ways of expression, the cinematography, acting, etc. BUT, Hotel Rwanda simply took me over as I was watching it. My emotion was going along with Paul ( Don Cheadle) all the time. The director did a great great job in capturing the feelings of people facing uncertainty, horror, ridicules, anger, death, waning faith... Family, life and dignity/integrity become the largest things in the situation. What&apos;s more is that it squarely shows the realist thinking in international politics.It honestly shows the weakness or helplessness of the UN and the non-governmental organizations. It truthfully tells how indifferent most of the international community (or individuals, which may or may not include you and me) are towards the deprivation of social justice taking place in other parts of the world. It makes you question to what extent that it is true to say what we see ( the sufferings in the world) is what we tolerate. It shows you how monstrous human being can be. It scares you how sanity would fail. At the same time, the uglier the people become, the more beautiful you find those who have managed to keep brave and maintain humanity. The movie fully succeeds in showing me the spirit, faith, and compassion that the world is dreaming for."

Hemsworths presentation of James Hunt is uncanny it&apos;s like a documentary he&apos;s almost as good as Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln.\n\nIf your not a F1 fan or from the 70&apos;s it may not be more than a blokes film, but give it a go it is going to end up being a important as Apollo 13 in the life of Mr Howard and quite frankly is by far the best car racing movie ever",

            "reviewBody": "When I was a kid there were only three major things in my life: food, wrestling and `Rocky&apos;. My brother and I followed the numerous Rocky Balboa struggles religiously, and even today, there is no exception. Although the latest efforts of Stallone have been pitiful, the movie that made his career is the 1977 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, `Rocky&apos;. On top of that, `Rocky&apos; also earned two more Academy Awards for Best Film-Editing and Best Director (John G. Avildsen).\n\nThis movie is unlike any other ever put on film. It&apos;s films like this that remind us of the beauty that is going to the cinema, and if only I was around during that year when such films as `Close Encounters of the Third Kind&apos;, `Jaws&apos;, `Saturday Night Fever&apos; and `Network&apos; were all playing in cinemas. The storyline takes place in Philadelphia, where Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) struggles to make a living as both a small-time boxer, and the brawn of a loan shark. Until one day, a sudden opportunity is handed to Rocky to compete for the World Heavy-Weight Title against the champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), a charismatic and flamboyant fighter labelled as `The King of Sting&apos; and `The Master Of Disaster&apos;. Attracted to Rocky&apos;s reputation as &quot;The Italian Stallion&quot;, a match between Creed and the unknown boxer is set, which is subsequently advertised as a fight where a &quot;nobody&quot; can become a &quot;somebody&quot;. Mickey (Burgess Meredith), is the owner of the gym where Rocky trains and later becomes Rocky&apos;s manager. Mickey is passionate about the world of boxing, and believes that Rocky has the potential to go the distance, instead of being `a cheap second rate loan-shark&apos;. However, the central character in Rocky&apos;s life is Adrian (Talia Shire), a shy pet-store clerk, who acts awkwardly when Rocky even breathes in her direction. However, these almost completely distant outcasts are strangely drawn to each other. While one `didn&apos;t have much of a brain&apos;, the other `didn&apos;t have much of a body&apos;, so they worked on their opposites, only to end up together. The legend of this film when it was first released in the mid-70&apos;s was: `His whole life was a-million-to-one shot&apos;, but what Stallone did was prove to the world that `Rocky&apos; is one-in-a-million.\n\nSeeing `Rocky&apos; is both a cinematic experience and a religious experience. When first released, the film appealed to the widest audience, and all felt the emotion and intense passion which passed from the film, to them. The film&apos;s possession of realistic acting, superb dialogue and the most phenomenal music score by Bill Conti to date, indeed transformed the face of cinema. Stallone&apos;s wholesome performance of his own screenplay is electrifying as the film celebrates of the underdog battling to beat the odds. Fans of cinema aren&apos;t manipulated into thinking that the inevitable will happen as it does in every other tedious hero drama.\n\nOver 25 years on, `Rocky&apos; still manages to let the audience&apos;s emotions explode; Rocky&apos;s blossoming relationship with Adrian, the seedy worlds of Mickey and Adrian&apos;s alcoholic brother, Paulie (Burt Young), and the affirmation of Rocky&apos;s inability to overcome Creed. And who could forget the excruciatingly compelling Balboa / Creed confrontation? Rocky&apos;s determination overturns the boxing fraternity, and supplies cinemaphiles with one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, as a body of spectators both on-screen and off applaud and chant for Rocky in unison. The following four Rocky sequels attempted to deliver the same magic as the original, however failed to convey it&apos;s message. `Rocky&apos; illustrates how life itself is stifling and perplexing, but sometimes when you lose your way as well as your original intentions, you may just find something better.\n\nSimply put, if anyone has a free Friday / Saturday night, this is the film to go out and borrow from the local video store. It&apos;s unbelievable that this film was only voted in at #78 on the AFI Top 100 films of all time, and worse yet, was voted in at the SECOND best sports film of all time (the first went to `Hoosiers&apos;, starring Gene Hackman). C&apos;mon people, be you black or white or brown or any other skin colour we have yet to discover, get out there and be inspired by Stallone&apos;s masterpiece, `Rocky&apos;.",

            "reviewBody": "A young man gets into the world of illegal dog fighting in order to get enough money together to be able to run away with his brother&apos;s wife, but in the meantime he starts tension with another dog owner. A beautiful young model signs a lucrative contract with a perfume company and moves into her new flat with her lover \u0096 only for her tragedy to strike and her dog to go missing. Finally an ex-convict and guerrilla mourns the wife he left decades ago and longs to meet the daughter who thinks he is dead \u0096 but is also contracted to kill a businessman. These three lives come together in a car crash that acts as a catalyst in changing their lives.\n\nAfter seeing 21 Grams I knew that I had to get round to seeing this film. With it&apos;s appearance on TV (BBC4 showing itself to really be a &apos;place to think&apos; and a wonderful channel to have) I took the opportunity to watch it, expecting a film that would match the good things I had heard about it. &gt;From the opening car chase that results in the crash that the film spirals outwards from like debris, through for most of the first hour, I was hooked \u0096 the pace was great and the story gripping. It was violent, exciting and yet had a human element to it as well. However the second story knocked the wind out of it for a moment, and seemed to lack the emotion of the first. It was based around an urban myth of sorts and wasn&apos;t as good \u0096 even if it did pick up towards the end.\n\nThe third story saw it return to a much more involving story of pain and the grinding out of life (as in &apos;getting by&apos;). Maybe it was the rich lifestyles of the characters in story two that stopped me caring as much \u0096 I don&apos;t know but I know that the contrast between one &amp; two made it more obvious how much the pace had dropped \u0096 especially when we are left wanted to know what happened to the characters we had spent an hour getting to care about. Anyway, the third story is a satisfying ending to the film and drew me back in emotionally where the second story had cut me off by it&apos;s abrupt start. Story two finishes before story three begins, and therefore it was easier to move on.\n\nI think the problem with this film for me was not the fact that three stories were intermingled but that I didn&apos;t think they were actually mixed well \u0096 the way the film moves away from characters before concluding their section (eg Octavia), the way the stories are actually quite separate from one another, these things and other I felt weakened the films \u0096 although each story was strong on it&apos;s own I just felt that story 2 was such a change to the film that it hurt it.\n\nHowever, as a film debut this is an amazing piece of work and is relentlessly impressive. From the opening car chase to the dog fights to the silent pain of the model looking out where her image once hung \u0096 in all these different moments I thought he did a great job and visually the film was never dull once no matter if it was set in a penthouse flat or a basement of an old building with the blood of dead dogs. And while we&apos;re on the subject, at the time of release I heard critics say they walked out of the film, refusing to watch cruelty to animals even being simulated. I can see their point but also think that they missed the fact that the animals in the film are mostly loved (even if they mostly die!) \u0096 however it is love and compassion for other humans that the film shows the characters having difficulty with, and this is where the emotional impact of the film is \u0096 not in simulated dogfights, albeit very well simulated dogfights that are hard to hear even if they are mostly unseen.\n\nThe cast were all natural but I always find it hard to judge performances when they are not in English. Having said that, there were no bad performances in the whole thing \u0096 even if some have better material to work with than others. Of course I still think this is a director&apos;s film and the cast often take second place to the style and the feel of the film.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this film but don&apos;t believe it deserves to be considered one of the &apos;best films ever made\u0099&apos;! The opening hour is superb and it&apos;s pace is relentless (even in more sensitive moments) but the sudden stop the film makes when it changes to story two is too much to stand and really caused the film to stutter for me. It gets better and is fully back on track for story three but there are problems running all through the narrative. Even though it has a lower rating on IMDb at time of writing, I&apos;d still say that 21 Grams offer this same fragmented style but with a much more satisfying narrative. Regardless of my nit picking I still think this is a powerful film that makes 150 minutes fly by with a huge amount of style from the first-time director, even if it does not live up to the endlessly gushing praise lavished upon it by many viewers."

            "reviewBody": "For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that&apos;s how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.\n\nSean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can&apos;t stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he&apos;s great as a director, having seen his work in &quot;The Pledge&quot; and &quot;The Crossing Guard.&quot; The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays &quot;Chris McCandless&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Alexander Supertramp&quot; reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.\n\nTwo people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (&quot;Ron France&quot;) again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn&apos;t acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as &quot;Tracy Tatro,&quot; who had a crush on &quot;Alex.&quot; This young woman is on her way to stardom.\n\nBrian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, &quot;Rainey&quot; and &quot;Jan.&quot; I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker&apos;s voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.\n\nKnowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don&apos;t remember them in the book but I&apos;ll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it&apos;s a a fascinating story and a beautiful film.",

            "reviewBody": "Brilliant, captivating, and sometimes just plain awesome are some of things that come to mind while watching yet another one of Miyazaki&apos;s epic tales: Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Winds. Deliberately slow-moving at points, yet undeniably exciting in and out of it&apos;s action sequences, and a fantastic introduction to anime itself.\n\nWithout revealing too much of the plot, it takes us through the life of Nausicaa, a princess of a small village, and her struggles to stop warring nations from destroying an important source that can save the planet. The planet has already gone through a major destruction that nearly wiped out humanity, and their are large insects called ohmu, that guard the source that is spreading through the world.\n\nMiyazaki introduces an empowerment of female characters in his animes, such as Princess Mononoke, Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service, and his most recent, Howl&apos;s Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro). The characters are done with style and care, and, in Nausicaa, there is no exception.\n\nIt amazes me that this film created some controversy when released, being banned in Poland because of it&apos;s depiction of an ecological disaster. Though the movie is obviously fantasy, it turns out that some may consider it a touchy subject. I didn&apos;t find any offense whatsoever with anything the movie showed, just a futuristic disaster no doubt caused by man.\n\nCombining fantasy and science-fiction, Nausicaa is nice to look at. It certainly shows it&apos;s age when compared to some newer animes, not having the help from high-end computers. Considering it was done in the 80&apos;s, Miyazaki&apos;s production team did a great job. Little details, backgrounds, gadgets, &amp; animals are drawn slightly better then some Japanese animes from that time.\n\nKeep in mind that my review is based on the Disney release (Feb 2005). It&apos;s cleaned up, unedited, with new voices from well known actors that sound great (but I still prefer subtitles). Keep far away from the old version &apos;Warriors of the Wind&apos;, which chops off more then half-hour from the movie.\n\n9 out of 10",

Jesse and Celine reunite after nine years. Things haven&apos;t turned out the way they had expected but here&apos;s a chance. &apos;Before Sunset&apos; follows pretty much the same style as &apos;Before Sunrise&apos;. This one too is very much a conversational piece. Here the score is used to a minimal. During the end we hear some songs including Julie Delpy&apos;s beautiful &apos;My Waltz&apos;. The cinematography consists of more long shots than in the first movie. The film has a very mature feel to it. Of course Jesse and Celine are a lot more mature today and less idealistic than they were nine years ago. Linklater beautifully captures the love between these two characters as he walks us through the streets of Paris. Here too the dialogues are just as magical as in the first movie except that this time there&apos;s a melancholy about the things that could have been, the years that they could have been together. Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are terrific as ever and they deserve additional praise for the writing and Ms. Delpy for her singing. Overall, &apos;Before Sunset&apos; has everything that made &apos;Before Sunrise&apos; a phenomenal movie experience."

            "reviewBody": "Consider this, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930&apos;s screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant. \n\nThe main reason &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra&apos;s direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra: &quot;That French broad likes money&quot; and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.\n\nThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father&apos;s private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.\n\nWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written: &quot;Far from lovey-dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome, but the road to get there is paved with arguments, anger and misunderstandings. It&apos;s also clever, funny and a bit risqu\u00e9 (for 1934)&quot; . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion&apos;s opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman. By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.\n\nAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director Oscar.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I&apos;m only a child.",

            "reviewBody": "SPOILER: Most of the ideas revealed through mystery by Bergman in Fanny och Alexander have already been addressed by others. The first time I saw this film was in 1984, on tv and with a much shorter version than the one released in England in 2002, which is the full 300-plus minute original.\n\nThat day I was scared -really scared- watching the scene where Alexander is been helped to let out his most evil thoughts by Ishmael, a completely mysterious character with supernatural insight. And then, a blackout. You can imagine: if I was truly scared this left me breathless.\n\nThen, almost twenty years passed until I found this remarkable jewel, in its full version, perfectly digitised and audio-enhanced in dvd. I bought a dlp projector and used a previewing room to show it to my students. I didn&apos;t know what was going to happen. But that doubt was worth the waiting.\n\nI think it&apos;s very difficult to say any other thing than breathtaking to underline what this film accomplishes. It&apos;s the reflected work of years of understanding and hard work between Bergman and Nyvqvist. One of the most powerful, beautiful, fearful and perfect films of all times. An exaggeration, like. Yes, but I think that there are no words to explain how plainly perfect this work is. The way it was written. The way it was directed. The way it was lighted. The way it was designed. The way each and every character plays his or her role. The details -not a Bergman&apos;s new- to which they paid the most dedicated attention to. The luxurious use of available light. The setting of the story. The amazing locations. Everything in this film was perfectly studied, down to the colour shifts that would take place in every shot!, forget about whole scenes!\n\nThe troubling minds of all those characters whose lives are at crossroads. The powerful and eventful lives of just one familiy. The small and big affairs that affect them. Gratitude and hate. Honour and shame. Guilt and love. Fear and joy. Selfishness and generosity. Every long scene exudes with tension, pure fun or pleasure; with increasing uneasiness and abrupt changes of demeanor. With a richness that could only be found where a very skillful eye -trained to see what most disregard as common- finds beauty and harmony. And a sound that is as exhilarating as the narrative depiction.\n\nWhen the maxim of making &quot;every frame a Rembrandt&quot; comes to my mind, this film makes me think Bergman pushed the envelope a little further: he gives (or I&apos;d rather say, Nyvqyst) the tratment of Van Der Meer or Bosch or Cezanne or Michelangelo to some scenes. (Think the kids playing at the nursery, the housemaidens sewing socks, the meadow and the boat, the transfixing scene of Alexander in the attic with his mother).\n\nAnd a story told from the eyes of two kids worth a ton of gold. Alexander&apos;s (Bertil Guve, when he was twelve-thirteen) enormously powerful and convincing role can certainly be compared to any big-theatre-role actor.\n\nSuperb. Don&apos;t think you&apos;ve seen the whole thing until you get the 5  hour full-story.",

As for Mollywood(Malayalam movie industry), it was one of the most prominent contributers for Indian Cinema. Big names like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Shaji.N.Karun are internationally acclaimed directors and actors like Mohanlal and Mammootty are the gems of Indian movies. Recently, Mollywood produces movies which are intolerable in quality, but still there are movies like Dhrishyam which will provide us sheer joy about our movies.\n\nWe grew up by watching movies of the big M&apos;s and we are proud of their potentials. We were also disappointed with their recent products which were dull and boring. Some say these actors were not meant to be working on Malayalam, instead they should work on some high-level industry. They also complains that here, we don&apos;t have much opportunities too. But we do make our merry with what we got, and Dhrishyam is one of those movies which utilized every bit of resource that provided by our industry. \n\nThe story is about a common man who tries to protect his family from a mishap, which took a young man&apos;s life. The script is good , and direction is also impressive. What makes Dhrishyam brilliant is that the unique performance of the lead actors. Mohanlal, famous for his flexible acting skills, dazzles as Georgekutty, a farmer-businessman who cares about his family through every event of the movie. Meena, Asha sarath were also good to watch. Shajon, normally type-casted as a comedian, Makes a brilliant turn-over to a character role.\n\nAs a final word, Dhrishyam is becoming a cult classic in Indian Cinema, and it spawns a new genre family crime thriller. Watch it. You&apos;ll never get disappointed...",

            "reviewBody": "A prostitute whose life is a veritable study in the resilience of the human spirit is the subject of `Nights of Cabiria,&apos; directed by Federico Fellini. Giulietta Masina stars as Cabiria, a gentle soul at heart who manages to maintain a positive outlook even in the face of adversity.  Experiences that would leave those of lesser mettle jaded she is seemingly able to ward off and emerge from intact, with a guarded optimism that nevertheless leaves her open to whatever ills life may have in store for her next.  But it is just that optimism and her sense of joy in the simple things that makes her so endearing.  She is proud, for example, of the fact that she owns her own house, hovel though it may be.  Though not one to be easily duped, she is vulnerable to sincere persistence, which has in the past rendered her victim to those who would take advantage of her, which is succinctly established in the opening scene of the film. \tFellini&apos;s film is a study of how good may succumb to evil, and yet still triumph in the end (though open to subjective interpretation).  It&apos;s something of an examination of endurance; how many times can one be knocked down before finally being unable to stand back up again.  At the same time, however, it&apos;s an example of how purity can prevail against even the utmost cruelty.  There is a humanity manifested in Cabiria that somehow gives absolution, not only to her lifestyle, but to those who would willingly do her harm.  And it is in that very same absolution that we find a message of hope and redemption. \tAs Cabiria, the diminutive Masina gives a performance that is nothing less than superlative, filled with nuance and expression.  She has a face and a manner that convey an unbelievable depth of emotion, and Fellini captures every bit of it with his camera to perfection.  It sometimes seems that she is a sprite merely masquerading as a woman; she has a light, almost ethereal presence, though at the same time she exhibits an earthy quality that gives her character such complexity, which removes any semblance of stereotype one may assign to her character as a `lady of the evening.&apos;  It is a heartfelt, memorable portrayal that quite simply should have earned her an Oscar for Best Actress.  Turning in a noteworthy performance, also, is Francois Perier, as Oscar D&apos;Onofrio, the stranger who comes into Cabiria&apos;s life with an offer that ultimately seems too good to be true. \tThe supporting cast includes Amedeo Nazzari (Alberto Lazzari), Aldo Silvani (The Hypnotist), Franca Marzi (Wanda), Dorian Gray (Jessy), Mario Passante (Cripple in the `Miracle&apos; sequence), Pina Gualandri (Matilda), Leo Cattozzo (Man with the sack) and Polidor (The Monk).  `Nights of Cabiria&apos; is a film of extraordinary depth that is beautiful as well in it&apos;s humanity; Fellini has created images, both visually and emotionally, that are stunning and indelibly realized.  Highlighted by the performance of Giulietta Masina, this is a film that begs to be embraced, one that will stay with you long after the last shadow has passed from the screen into darkness.  In Cabiria, Fellini somehow touches something eternal, for there is a lasting sense of innate goodness about her that simply cannot be forgotten.  For seekers after wisdom and truth, this is definitely a film that must not be missed. I rate this one 10/10.",

            "reviewBody": "This movie is set in mediaeval Russia, the world of unspeakable cruelty, poverty and injustice. And yet, this is a profoundly humanistic, profoundly spiritual, profoundly individualistic and profoundly uncompromising film. The photography is absolutely beautiful, mesmerising, original and superb. But it is the anguished soul and conscience of this film and of its main hero that truly make this a great picture.\n\nThere are no cliches here, no stereotypes and no sucking up to the audience. A brutally honest and yet very moving, touching and optimistic film. And it is not about the nature of a genius. Rather, it is about a man&apos;s ability and duty to preserve and be true to his humanity, his freedom, his soul, his heart and his gift, no matter what century it is or what the circumstances are. Watch it to remind yourself of what it really means to be human.",

            "reviewBody": "An epic series like Neon Genesis Evangelion comes to a close with the final installment, End of Evangelion. A masterpiece like Neon Genesis Evangelion should have an ending to live up to the show&apos;s greatness. End of Evangelion delivers and finally puts an end to the well told but complex story of Evangelion. With all the Angels defeated will SEELE be able to pull off its underlying ultimate plan? Will End of Evangelion bring the demise of the lovable characters of Evangelion? End of Evangelion starts off with the invasion of NERV as order by the secretive organization SEELE. SEELE is trying to seize EVA Unit 01 so they can start the Third Impact and realize their plans. The fate of mankind lies in Shinji Ikari who has psychologically given up at the start of the movie because of certain choices he makes. Meanwhile Asuka is being tormented because of her mother&apos;s death in the past.\n\nThe movie has some of the best animating I have seen in an anime movie. The animation is fluid and smooth. It is very well done by I.G. Productions (who did Ghost in the Shell and FLCL) and GAINAX Studios. Although I am a fan of the original Japanese cast, the English dub of this movie is one of the best dubs I have ever heard in an anime movie. The sound quality is amazing on the DVD, boasting 5.1 Dolby Digital EX Surround Sound in both English and Japanese. The DVD also includes a bonus commentary track with the voice actors and actresses; led by the voice actress who does Rei&apos;s voice in the English dub. It offers a lot of insight into the movie.\n\nThe story the movie follows is brilliant. Many fans of the series who were disappointed with the final two episodes of Evangelion; most think that End of Evangelion is an alternative ending. End of Evangelion tells the same story that episodes 25 and 26 but in the way the creators of the series originally wanted it. A great team like the one who made Evangelion would not change their artistic vision to meet the demands of lack luster fans. Director Hideaki Anno does an excellent in telling the story of the movie that puts Evangelion to a close.\n\nEnd of Evangelion only falls short in one aspect. Many fans of the movie find it confusing and do not get the full point of the movie. They are disappointed in End of Evangelion because they lack understanding of the story. But this is not End of Evangelion&apos;s fault. The movie does an excellent job of telling the story and any fan who wants insight into this movie should watch it with the commentary and read the synopsis. I rather not hand anyone the answers but let them take it upon themselves to go out to find them. Once fans understand everything that is happening in the movie, they will see why it is such a masterpiece.\n\nThe movie End of Evangelion is one of the best movies ever created; it is second to none. The movie is excellent, the story development is incredible and the characters are brilliant. End of Evangelion is a true work of genius and deserves a perfect rating.",
